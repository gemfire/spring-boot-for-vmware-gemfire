The definitive source of truth on how to best use [spring-boot-gemfire-name] is to refer to the [samples](#geode-samples).

See also the [Temperature
Service](https://github.com/jxblum/temperature-service), Spring Boot
application that implements a temperature sensor and monitoring,
Internet of Things (IOT) example. The example uses [spring-boot-gemfire-name] to showcase
[vmware-gemfire-name] CQ, function implementations and executions, and
positions [vmware-gemfire-name] as a caching provider in Springâ€™s Cache
Abstraction. It is a working, sophisticated, and complete example, and
we highly recommend it as a good starting point for real-world use
cases.

See the [Boot
example](https://github.com/jxblum/contacts-application/tree/master/boot-example)
from the contact application reference implementation (RI) for [spring-data-gemfire-name] as yet another example.
