Using Spring Data Repositories with [vmware-gemfire-name] makes short
work of data access operations when you use [vmware-gemfire-name] as
your System of Record (SoR) to persist your application’s state.





https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/commons/docs/current/reference/html/#repositories\[Spring Data
Repositories\] provide a convenient and powerful way to define basic
CRUD and simple query data access operations by specifying the contract
of those data access operations in a Java interface.





[spring-boot-gemfire-name] auto-configures the [spring-data-gemfire-name]
https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/geode/docs/current/reference/html/#gemfire-repositories\[Repository
extension\] when either is declared on your application’s classpath. You
need not do anything special to enable it. You can start coding your
application-specific Repository interfaces.





The following example defines a `Customer` class to model customers and
map it to the [vmware-gemfire-name] `Customers` Region by using the [spring-data-gemfire-name]
https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/data/gemfire/mapping/annotation/Region.html\[`@Region`\]
mapping annotation:







Example 1. `Customer` entity class









``` highlight
package example.app.crm.model;

@Region("Customers")
class Customer {

    @Id
    private Long id;

    private String name;

}
```











The following example shows how to declare your Repository (a.k.a.
{wikipedia-docs}/Data_access_object\[Data Access Object (DAO)\]) for
`Customers`:







Example 2. `CustomerRepository` for peristing and accessing `Customers`









``` highlight
package example.app.crm.repo;

interface CustomerRepository extends CrudRepository<Customer, Long> {

    List<Customer> findByLastNameLikeOrderByLastNameDescFirstNameAsc(String customerLastNameWildcard);

}
```











Then you can use the `CustomerRepository` in an application service
class:







Example 3. Inject and use the `CustomerRepository`









``` highlight
package example.app;

@SpringBootApplication
@EnableEntityDefinedRegions(basePackageClasses = Customer.class)
class SpringBootApacheGeodeClientCacheApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(SpringBootApacheGeodeClientCacheApplication.class, args);
    }

    @Bean
    ApplicationRunner runner(CustomerRepository customerRepository) {

        // Matches Williams, Wilson, etc.
        List<Customer> customers =
            customerRepository.findByLastNameLikeOrderByLastNameDescFirstNameAsc("Wil%");

        // process the list of matching customers...
    }
}
```











See Spring Data Commons'
https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/commons/docs/current/reference/html/#repositories\[Repositories
abstraction\] and [spring-data-gemfire-name]'s
https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/geode/docs/current/reference/html/#gemfire-repositories\[Repositories
extension\] for more detail.
