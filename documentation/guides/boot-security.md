This guide walks you through building a simple Spring Boot application
enabled with Security, specifically Auth and TLS using SSL. You should
already be familiar with Spring Boot and [vmware-gemfire-name].

Refer to the <a
href="../index.html#geode-security">Security</a> chapter in the
reference documentation for more information.

## Background

Security is critical to most applications. It is important to be able to
control who or what can access your application and what the subject is
allowed to do. This is where Auth<sup>2</sup> (Authentication &
Authorization) comes in.

Authentication is used to verify a client’s identity (human or
application) in exchange for some sort of credentials. Once
authenticated, a client must be authorized before they can perform any
actions. Authorization checks the permissions required to perform an
action (e.g. read data, modify data, change configuration, and so on)
against the permissions assigned to the client’s identity

Of course, sending passwords and other sensitive information as plain
text over the wire is not very secure, so we also need to enable SSL/TLS
to encrypt the information as it is transmitted. Now, our applications
are secure.

<p class="caution"><strong>Caution:</strong>
Neither [vmware-gemfire-name] nor [spring-boot-gemfire-name] provides any support for
<em>securing</em> <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_at_rest"><em>data at
rest</em></a>, such as with <em>disk encryption</em>. This concern is
typically left to hardware-based solutions.
</p>

See the [spring-boot-gemfire-name]
chapter on <a href="../index.html#geode-security">Security</a> for more
information.


## Securing a Client Application

Enabling auth on the client is mostly taken care of by Spring Boot’s
Auto-configuration.

For more details on Spring Boot’s Auto-configuration
applied to Security, and securing the client and server, see <a
href="boot-configuration.html#geode-samples-boot-configuration-clientserver-security">here</a>.

In Spring Boot `application.properties`, set the
`spring.data.gemfire.security.username` and
`spring.data.gemfire.security.password` properties to the username and
password your application will use to authenticate.

Enabling SSL on the client requires you to put a `trusted.keystore` file
(a *Java KeyStore*) in a well-known place, such as your application’s
working directory or your home directory, and Auto-configuration will do
the rest.

If your `trusted.keystore` has a password (as it should), you will need
to specify it using the
`spring.data.gemfire.security.ssl.keystore.password` property in your
Spring Boot `application.properties` file. You can generate a Keystore
using [Java
Keytool](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/unix/keytool.html).

See [spring-boot-gemfire-name]’s  chapter
on <a href="../index.html#geode-security-auth-clients">Auth for
Clients</a> for more information.


## Securing a Server Application

Auto-configuration does not do as much for you when configuring auth on
the server as it does on the client. In order to enable auth, you need
to do two things.

First, annotate your configuration class with `@EnableSecurity`. Second,
because [vmware-gemfire-name]’s security is integrated with Apache Shiro,
define at least one Shiro Realm as a bean in your Spring
`ApplicationContext`.

Example Shiro Realm bean:

``` highlight
    @Bean
    PropertiesRealm shiroRealm() {

        PropertiesRealm propertiesRealm = new PropertiesRealm();

        propertiesRealm.setResourcePath("classpath:shiro.properties");
        propertiesRealm.setPermissionResolver(new GeodePermissionResolver());

        return propertiesRealm;
    }
```

You can find more information on Apache Shiro and how to configure a
Realm [here](https://shiro.apache.org/realm).

Enabling SSL on the server is essentially the same as for the client,
just put your `trusted.keystore` file (a *Java KeyStore*) in a
well-known place, like your application’s working directory or your home
directory. If your `trusted.keystore` has a password (as it should), you
will need to specify it using the
`spring.data.gemfire.security.ssl.keystore.password` property in your
Spring Boot `application.properties` file. You can generate a Keystore
using [Java
Keytool](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/unix/keytool.html).

See [spring-boot-gemfire-name]’s  chapter
on <a href="../index.html#geode-security-auth-servers">Auth for
Servers</a> for more information.


## Example

To demonstrate the proper way to configure a Spring Boot application
with security, we put together a simple example. The example is made up
of two main parts:

A client - `BootGemFireSecurityClientApplication`.

A server - `BootGemFireSecurityServerApplication`.

### What it Does

The example is very minimal and only performs some basic data access
operations in a secure context. The server starts up, and then the
client connects to the server and tries to do two things:

1.  Write a new value into Customers, which succeeds.

2.  Read a value from Customers, which fails because the user that the
    client authenticates with is only authorized to write data, not read
    it.

This behavior may change depending on the credentials used to
authenticate. For example, running with “*cluster_operator*” credentials
on the platform will result in both read and write operations
succeeding.

### Classes

#### BootGemFireSecurityClientApplication

Spring Boot, [vmware-gemfire-name] Client Application

``` highlight
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableClusterAware
@EnableEntityDefinedRegions(basePackageClasses = Customer.class)
public class BootGemFireSecurityClientApplication {

    private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger("example.app.security");

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        new SpringApplicationBuilder(BootGemFireSecurityClientApplication.class)
            .web(WebApplicationType.SERVLET)
            .build()
            .run(args);
    }

    @Bean
    ApplicationRunner runner(@Qualifier("customersTemplate") GemfireTemplate customersTemplate) {

        return args -> {

            Customer williamEvans = Customer.newCustomer(2L, "William Evans");

            customersTemplate.put(williamEvans.getId(), williamEvans);

            logger.info("Successfully put [{}] in Region [{}]",
                williamEvans, customersTemplate.getRegion().getName());

            try {
                logger.info("Attempting to read from Region [{}]...", customersTemplate.getRegion().getName());
                customersTemplate.get(2L);
            }
            catch (Exception cause) {
                logger.info("Read failed because \"{}\"", cause.getCause().getCause().getMessage());
            }
        };
    }
}
```

This class is a Spring Boot, [vmware-gemfire-name] client application (i.e.
`ClientCache`) configured to authenticate when connecting to a cluster
of servers using connections secured with SSL.

The `@SpringBootApplication` annotation declares the application to be a
Spring Boot application. With [spring-boot-gemfire-name] on the application classpath, a
`ClientCache` instance will be auto-configured automatically, making the
application a cache client capable of connecting to the cluster.

Finally, we declare a `ApplicationRunner` bean to perform some basic
data access operations secured by the server to observe the effects of
security.

Because SDBG auto-configures a
<code>ClientCache</code> instance by default, you do not need to
explicitly annotate your <code>@SpringBootApplication</code> class with
[spring-data-gemfire-name]’s <code>@ClientCacheApplication</code> annotation. In fact doing so
disables some of the auto-configuration, like security, applied by [spring-boot-gemfire-name]
OOTB. The same is true when you declare one of the
[<code>@PeerCacheApplication</code>,
<code>@CacheServerApplication</code>] annotations, which changes your
<code>@SpringBootApplication</code> class completely, from a client to a
server-side [vmware-gemfire-name] process. Therefore, be careful! See the
relevant <a
href="../index.html#geode-clientcache-applications">chapter</a> in the
reference documentation for more details.

#### BootGemFireSecurityServerApplication

Spring Boot, [vmware-gemfire-name] Server Application

``` highlight
@SpringBootApplication
@CacheServerApplication
@EnableSecurity
public class BootGemFireSecurityServerApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        new SpringApplicationBuilder(BootGemFireSecurityServerApplication.class)
            .web(WebApplicationType.NONE)
            .build()
            .run(args);
    }

    @Bean
    PropertiesRealm shiroRealm() {

        PropertiesRealm propertiesRealm = new PropertiesRealm();

        propertiesRealm.setResourcePath("classpath:shiro.properties");
        propertiesRealm.setPermissionResolver(new GeodePermissionResolver());

        return propertiesRealm;
    }
}
```

This class is a Spring Boot, [vmware-gemfire-name] server application (i.e.
`CacheServer`) that requires clients (i.e. `ClientCache`) to
authenticate when connecting to the server and to communicate using SSL.

Unlike the client application class above, we annotate this
`@SpringBootApplication` class with `@CacheServerApplication` to
override the default `ClientCache` auto-configured by [spring-boot-gemfire-name] OOTB. This
makes the application a [vmware-gemfire-name] server on startup, capable of
serving clients.

We must additionally annotate the server application class with [spring-boot-gemfire-name]’s
`@EnableSecurity` annotation to enable [vmware-gemfire-name] Security on the
server-side. By explicitly declaring a `PropertiesRealm` bean, we are
using Apache Shiro as the auth provider, supplying the security
credentials (users, roles and permissions) via a Java Properties file:

Apache Shiro Properties file containing the security credentials
configuration

``` highlight
# Assign user 'jdoe' the role of 'viewer' having 'DATA:WRITE' permissions.
user.jdoe = p@55w0rd, viewer
role.viewer = DATA:WRITE
```

In addition to the auth (authentication/authorization) configuration, we
must additionally supply a Java Keystore file to encrypt the connection
between the client and server using SSL, as discussed above. All you
need to do is create a Java Keystore file and put it in your application
classpath root. [spring-boot-gemfire-name] will [take care of the
rest](../index.html#geode-security-ssl).

Of course, if you have secured your Java Keystore file with a password
(as you should) then you must additionally supply the password in
`application.properties`, like so:

Application.properties containing Auth (username/password) and SSL
configuration

``` highlight
# Spring Boot client application.properties

spring.data.gemfire.management.use-http=false
spring.data.gemfire.security.username = jdoe
spring.data.gemfire.security.password = p@55w0rd
spring.data.gemfire.security.ssl.keystore.password=s3cr3t
```

The SSL related configuration is used by both the client and server.

#### Customer

Customer class

``` highlight
@Region("Customers")
@EqualsAndHashCode
@ToString(of = "name")
@RequiredArgsConstructor(staticName = "newCustomer")
public class Customer {

    @Id @NonNull @Getter
    private Long id;

    @NonNull @Getter
    private String name;

}
```

This is a simple application domain class to represent a customer. The
`Customer` class is annotated with [spring-data-gemfire-name]’s `@Region` mapping annotation to
declare that the "*Customers*" `Region` will contain `Customer` objects
that will be accessed securely from the client.

#### SecurityController

SecurityController class

``` highlight
@RestController
public class SecurityController {

    @Autowired
    private Environment environment;

    @GetMapping("/message")
    public String getMessage() {
        return String.format("I'm using SSL with this Keystore: %s",
            this.environment.getProperty("spring.data.gemfire.security.ssl.keystore"));
    }
}
```

This class is a Spring `RestController` exposing an REST service
endpoint at “*/message*” to verify the clients use of SSL.


### Running the Example

#### Running Locally

To run the example, first start the `BootGemFireSecurityServerApplication`
and then run `BootGemFireSecurityClientApplication`.

In the terminal you should see the following output:

Output when running locally

``` highlight
Successfully put [Customer(name=William Evans)] in Region [Customers]
Attempting to read from Region [Customers]...
Read failed because "jdoe not authorized for DATA:READ:Customers:2"
```

You can also hit the endpoint at
[localhost:8080/message](http://localhost:8080/message) to verify the
application is using SSL.

#### Running on [vmware-gemfire-name] \[VMs\]

In order for this sample to work, your [vmware-gemfire-name] \[VMs\] tile
must be setup to work with TLS. Instructions to enable TLS for the
[vmware-gemfire-name] \[VMs\] tile can be found
[here](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-GemFire-for-Tanzu-Application-Service/1.14/gf-tas/content-tls-enabled-app.html?hWord=N4IghgNiBcIOYFMC2AzAlgJwQAgC5gDsAvAVzwgGcQBfIA).

Once TLS has been enabled, create your service instance with the
`-c '{"tls":true}'` flag.

For example:

Create Service Instance enabled with TLS

``` highlight
cf create-service p-cloudcache [plan-name] [service-instance-name] -c '{"tls":true}'
```

Replace `[plan-name]` with the plan you are selecting and
`[service-instance-name]` with the desired name of your service.

Update `manifest.yml` with the `[service-instance-name]`

``` highlight
services:
- [your-service-instance-name]
```

Before deploying the application to the platform, you must update the
username and password in the `application.properties` file with the
correct credentials for your service instance.

Once your service instance is created you’ll need to create a
service-key for the service.

Create Service Key

``` highlight
cf create-service-key [service-instance-name] [service-key-name]
```

Replace `[service-instance-name]` with the name of your service instance
(from above). `[service-key-name]` is what you would like to call this
service key.

Once the service key is created, access the credentials in the service
with the following command:

Review Service Key Details

``` highlight
cf service-key [service-instance-name] [service-key-name]
```

Replace `[service-instance-name]` with the name of your service instance
and `[service-key-name]` with the name of your service key (from the
previous step above).

In the output, look for the “users” section. For this example, we used
the “*cluster_operator*” user credentials.

VCAP_SERVICES credentials block

``` highlight
{
...
 "users": [
  {
   "password": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
   "roles": [
    "cluster_operator"
   ],
   "username": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
  },
  {
   "password": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
   "roles": [
    "developer"
   ],
   "username": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
  },
  {
   "password": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
   "roles": [
    "readonly"
   ],
   "username": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
  }
 ],
 "wan": {}
}
```

Now build the sample with Gradle:

Build with Gradle

``` highlight
$ gradlew :spring-geode-samples-boot-security:build
```

Then push the application to the platform using `cf push`.

Push to CF

``` highlight
$ cf push <app-name> -u none -p ~/spring-boot-data-geode/spring-geode-samples/boot/security/build/libs/spring-geode-samples-boot-security-{spring-boot-data-geode-version}.jar
...
```

Once the app is running, check the logs with
`cf logs security-app --recent` and you should see output like the
following:

Log output from the platform

``` highlight
Successfully put [Customer(name=William Evans)] in Region [Customers]
Attempting to read from Region [Customers]...
Read failed because "jdoe not authorized for DATA:READ:Customers:2"
```

You can also hit the endpoint at
<https://security-app.apps.%3Ccf-instance%3E.cf-app.com/message>.

Replace `<cf-instance>` with the name of your CloudFoundry instance to
verify that the application is using SSL.

Congratulations! You have taken your first steps towards securing an
[vmware-gemfire-name] application with Spring Boot.
