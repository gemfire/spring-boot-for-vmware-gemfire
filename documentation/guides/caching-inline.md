This guide walks you through building a simple Spring Boot application
using [Spring’s Cache
Abstraction](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/integration.html#cache)
backed by [vmware-gemfire-name] as the caching provider for Inline Caching.

It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the Spring *programming
model*. No prior knowledge of Spring’s *Cache Abstraction* or [vmware-gemfire-name] is required to utilize caching in your Spring Boot applications.

Additionally, this Sample builds on the concepts from the [Look-Aside
Caching with Spring](caching-look-aside.html) guide. Therefore, it would
be helpful to have read that guide before proceeding through this guide.

Let’s begin.

Refer to the <a
href="../index.html#geode-caching-provider-inline-caching">Inline
Caching</a> section, and specifically the <a
href="../index.html#geode-caching-provider-inline-caching-synchronous">Synchronous
Inline Caching</a>, in the <a
href="../index.html#geode-caching-provider">Caching with [vmware-gemfire-name]</a> chapter of the reference documentation for more
information.


## Background

Caching, and in particular, *Look-Aside Caching*, is useful in cases
where the output of an operation yields the same results when given the
same input. If an expensive operation is frequently invoked with the
same input, then it will benefit from caching, especially if the
operation is compute intensive, IO bound, such as by accessing data over
a network, and so forth.

Consider a very simple mathematical function, the *factorial*. A
*factorial* is defined as `factorial(n) = n!`. For example, if I call
`factorial(5)`, then the computation is `5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1` and the
result will be `120`. If I call `factorial(5)` over and over, the result
will always be the same. The *factorial* calculation is a good candidate
for caching.

While a *factorial* might not be that expensive to compute, it
illustrates the characteristics of an operation that would benefit from
caching.

In most *Look-Aside Caching* use cases, the cache is not expected to be
the "*source of truth*". That is, the application is backed by some
other data source, or *System of Record* (SOR), such as a database. The
cache merely reduces resource consumption and contention on the database
by keeping frequently accessed data in memory for quick lookup when the
data is not changing constantly.

It is not that the data cannot or does not ever change, only that the
data is read far more than it is written, and when it is written, the
cache entry is simply invalidated and reloaded, either lazily when data
is next needed by the application, or the data can be eagerly loaded, if
necessary. Either way, the cache is **not** the "*source of truth*" and
therefore does not strictly need to be consistent with the database.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong>
Do not take "<em>inconsistency</em>" between the
cache and database to mean that the application will read stale data. It
simply means there will be a penalty to reload/refresh the data the next
time the data is requested.
</p>

But, this guide is not about Look-Aside Caching, it is about *Inline
Caching*. While *Inline Caching* can take several forms, the form of
*Inline Caching* we present here will be an extension to the *Look-Aside
Cache* pattern.

This particular form of *Inline Caching* is useful in cases where:

1.  Consistency between the Cache and Database is important, or…​

2.  Having access to the latest, most up-to-date information from the
    backend SOR is crucial (e.g. time sensitive).

3.  Multiple, discrete & disparate applications are sharing the same
    data source (contrary to Microservices design).

4.  The application is distributed across multiple sites.

There maybe other reasons.

*Spring’s Cache Abstraction* offers a basic form of *Inline Caching* if
you consider the overloaded
[`Cache.get(Object key, Callable<T> valueLoader):T`](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/cache/Cache.html#get-java.lang.Object-java.util.concurrent.Callable-)
method. The overloaded `Cache.get(..)` method accepts a `Callable`
argument, which serves the purpose of loading a value from an external
data source, as defined by the `Callable`, on a cache miss. If a value
for the given key is not present in the cache, then the `Callable` will
be invoked to load a value for the given key.

This form of *Inline Caching* is very basic since 1) most application
developers are not interfacing with *Spring’s Cache Abstraction* in
their application by using the `org.springframework.cache.Cache` API
directly. Most of the time, application developers will use the Spring
cache annotations (e.g. `@Cacheable`), or alternatively, the JSR-107,
JCache API annotations, as
[documented](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/integration.html#cache-jsr-107).
2) Second, while `Cache.get(..)` satisfies *read-through* to the
backend, external data source, there is no equivalent operation in the
`Cache` API for *write-through*, i.e. when using `Cache.put(key, value)`
to put a value into the cache in addition to writing back to the
external data source.

With *Inline Caching*, the *read & write through* to/from the backend
data source are intrinsic characteristics of *Inline Caching*.
Additionally, on *write-through*, the cache op (i.e. `put(key, value)`)
does not succeed unless the backend data source has been updated. In
essence, the cache and backend data source are kept in-sync and
therefore consistent.

<p class="caution"><strong>Caution:</strong>
There are still moments when the cache could be
observed in an inconsistent state relative to the backend database, such
as between a database update and a cache refresh on a cache hit. This
means the value was in the cache but may not have been the latest value
when requested since the database may have been updated by some other
means (e.g. another application updating the database directly, not
using <em>Inline Caching</em> with a synchronous
<em>write-through</em>). To keep the cache and database consistent, then
all data access operations must involve the cache. That is, you must
strictly adhere to and be diligent in your use of <em>Inline
Caching</em>.

*Inline Caching* can be depicted in the following diagram:

![Inline Caching Pattern](./images/Inline-Caching-Pattern.png)

In the diagram above, there are 2 flows: 1 for *read-through*
(right-side) and another for *write-through* (left-side). Both can occur
in a single operation, on a read.

When a client sends a request for data (**\#6**) the request invokes the
appropriate application (`@Cacheable`) service method, which is
immediately forwarded to the cache to determine if the results for the
given input have already been computed (**\#5**). If the result is
cached (a *cache hit*), then the result is simply returned to the
caller. However, if a result had not been previously computed, or the
result expired, or was evicted, then before the cacheable service method
is invoked, an additional lookup is performed (**\#4**) to determine
whether the computed value may have already been persisted to the
backend database. If the value exists in the database, then it is loaded
into the cache and returned to the caller. Only when the computed value
is not present in the cache nor exists in the database is the cacheable
service method invoked. Once the service method finishes and returns the
result, the value is cached as part of the contract of `@Cacheable` and
will also be written through to the backend database.

During a client request to compute some value regardless of the cache or
database state (**\#1**), the service method is always invoked (as
specified in the contract for the `@CachePut` annotation). Upon
completing the computation, the result is cached (**\#2**) and
additionally persisted to the database (**\#3**), which describes the
*write-through*. If the database INSERT/UPDATE is not successful on
write, then the cache will not contain the value.

Now it is time to make all of this a bit more concrete with an example.


## Example

For our example, we will develop a calculator application that performs
basic mathematical functions, such as `factorial`. Again, not that
practical, but a useful and simple demonstration allowing us to focus on
our primary concern, which is to enable and use *Inline Caching*.

### Caching-enabled CalculatorService

We start by defining the supported mathematical functions in a
`CalculatorService` class.

CalculatorService interface

``` highlight
@Service
public class CalculatorService extends AbstractCacheableService {

    @Cacheable(value = "Factorials", keyGenerator = "resultKeyGenerator")
    public ResultHolder factorial(int number) {

        this.cacheMiss.set(true);

        Assert.isTrue(number >= 0L,
            String.format("Number [%d] must be greater than equal to 0", number));

        simulateLatency();

        if (number <= 2) {
            return ResultHolder.of(number, Operator.FACTORIAL, number == 2 ? 2 : 1);
        }

        int operand = number;
        int result = number;

        while (--number > 1) {
            result *= number;
        }

        return ResultHolder.of(operand, Operator.FACTORIAL, result);
    }

    @Cacheable(value = "SquareRoots", keyGenerator = "resultKeyGenerator")
    public ResultHolder sqrt(int number) {

        this.cacheMiss.set(true);

        Assert.isTrue(number >= 0,
            String.format("Number [%d] must be greater than equal to 0", number));

        simulateLatency();

        int result = Double.valueOf(Math.sqrt(number)).intValue();

        return ResultHolder.of(number, Operator.SQUARE_ROOT, result);
    }
}
```

The `CalculatorService` is annotated with Spring’s `@Service` stereotype
annotation so that it will be picked up by the Spring Container’s
classpath component scan process, which has been carefully configured by
Spring Boot. The class also extends the `AbstractCacheableService` base
class, inheriting a couple `boolean` methods that signal whether cache
access resulted in a hit or miss.

In addition, the `CalculatorService` contains two mathematical
functions: `factorial` and `sqrt` (*square root*). Each method caches
the result of the computation using the input (operand) and operator as
the key. If the method is called 2 or more times with the same input,
the cached result will be returned, providing the cache entry has not
expired or been evicted. We neither configure eviction nor expiration
for this example, however.

Both the `factorial(..)` and `sqrt(..)` methods have been annotated with
Spring’s `@Cacheable` annotation to demarcate these methods with caching
behavior. Of course, as explained in [spring-boot-gemfire-name]’s
[documentation](../_includes/configuration-annotations.html#geode-caching-provider),
caching with Spring’s Cache Abstraction using [vmware-gemfire-name] as the
caching provider is enabled by default. Therefore, there is nothing more
you need do to start leverage caching in your Spring Boot applications
than to annotate the service methods with the appropriate Spring or
JSR-107, JCache API annotations. Simple!

It is worth noting that we are starting with the same applied pattern of
caching as you would when using the *Look-Aside Caching* pattern. This
is key to minimizing the invasive nature of *Inline Caching*. There is a
subtle difference, though, and that will be apparent in the additional
configuration we supply as part of our Spring Boot application.

Let’s look at that next.

### Inline Caching Configuration

The following illustrates the additional configuration required to
enable *Inline Caching*:

CalculatorConfiguration

``` highlight
@Configuration
@EnableCachingDefinedRegions(clientRegionShortcut = ClientRegionShortcut.LOCAL)
@EntityScan(basePackageClasses = ResultHolder.class)
@SuppressWarnings("unused")
public class CalculatorConfiguration {

    @Bean
    InlineCachingRegionConfigurer<ResultHolder, ResultHolder.ResultKey> inlineCachingForCalculatorApplicationRegionsConfigurer(
            CalculatorRepository calculatorRepository) {

        Predicate<String> regionBeanNamePredicate = regionBeanName ->
            Arrays.asList("Factorials", "SquareRoots").contains(regionBeanName);

        return new InlineCachingRegionConfigurer<>(calculatorRepository, regionBeanNamePredicate);
    }

    @Bean
    KeyGenerator resultKeyGenerator() {

        return (target, method, arguments) -> {

            int operand = Integer.parseInt(String.valueOf(arguments[0]));

            Operator operator = "sqrt".equals(method.getName())
                ? Operator.SQUARE_ROOT
                : Operator.FACTORIAL;

            return ResultHolder.ResultKey.of(operand, operator);
        };
    }
}
```

The pertinent part of the configuration that enables *Inline Caching*
for our Calculator application is contained in the
`inlineCachingForCalculatorApplicationRegionsConfigurer` bean
definition.

[spring-boot-gemfire-name] provides the `InlineCachingRegionConfigurer` class used in the bean
definition to configure and enable the caches (a.k.a. as Regions in
[vmware-gemfire-name] terminology) with *Inline Caching* behavior.

The Configurer’s job is to configure the appropriate Spring Data (SD)
*Repository* used as a Region’s `CacheLoader` for "*read-through*"
behavior as well as configure the same SD *Repository* for a Region’s
`CacheWriter` for "*write-through*" behavior. This
"*read/write-through*" behavior is the "inlining" component of *Inline
Caching*, i.e. the second lookup opportunity we talked about in the
[Background](#geode-samples-caching-inline-background) section above.

The `CacheLoader/Writer` also ensures consistency between the cache and
the backend data store, such as a database.

The *Repository* plugged in by our application configuration is the
`CalculatorRepository`:

CalculatorRepository

``` highlight
public interface CalculatorRepository
        extends CrudRepository<ResultHolder, ResultHolder.ResultKey> {

    Optional<ResultHolder> findByOperandEqualsAndOperatorEquals(Number operand, Operator operator);

}
```

Spring Data’s Repository abstraction is used rather
than providing direct access to some <code>DataSource</code> for the
backend data store since 1) Spring Data Repository abstraction <a
href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-data">supports</a> a wide-array
of backend data stores uniformly and 2) it is easy to compose multiple
Spring Data Repositories as one (using the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_pattern">Composite
pattern</a>) if you want to write to multiple backend data stores and 3)
Spring Data has a very consistent and intuitive API, based on the <a
href="https://www.baeldung.com/java-dao-pattern">Data Access Object
(DAO) pattern</a> for defining basic CRUD and simple query data access
operations. Typically, the <code>DataSource</code> must be wrapped by a
higher-level API to make use of the backend data store in Java anyway,
like JDBC for databases, or even higher, such as by using an ORM tool
(e.g. JPA with Hibernate).

The second argument in the configuration for the
`InlineCachingRegionConfigurer` includes a required `Predicate` used to
target the specific caches (Regions) on which *Inline Caching* should be
enabled and used. You can target all regions by simply supplying the
following `Predicate`:

Predicate targeting all caches (Regions)

``` highlight
Predicate<String> predicate = () -> regionBeanName -> true;
```

In our case, we only want to target the Regions that have been used as
"caches" as identified in the service methods annotated with Spring’s
`@Cacheable` annotation, to be enabled with and use *Inline Caching*.

The `Predicate` allows you to target different Regions using different
Spring Data *Repositories*, and by extension different backend data
stores, for different purposes, depending on your application uses
cases.

For example, you may have a cache Region X containing data that needs to
be stored in MongoDB (use [Spring Data
MongoDB](https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-mongodb)), where as
another cache Region Y may contain data that needs to be written to
Neo4j and represented as a graph (use [Spring Data
Neo4j’s](https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-neo4j)), and yet another
cache Region Z containing data that needs to be written back to a
database (use [Spring Data
JDBC](https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-jdbc) or [Spring Data
JPA](https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-jpa)).

This is what makes the Spring Data *Repository* pattern so ideal. It is
very flexible and has a highly consistent API across a disparate
grouping of data stores. And due to that uniformity, it is easy to
"adapt" the [vmware-gemfire-name] `CacheLoader`/`CacheWriter` interfaces to use
a SD Repository under-the-hood. Indeed, that is exactly what [spring-boot-gemfire-name] has
done for you!

We will circle back to the `resultKeyGenerator` bean definition after we
talk about the application domain model.

Also notice the use of the `@EnableCachingDefinedRegions` annotation.

Whenever you use a caching provider like [vmware-gemfire-name] or Redis, you
must explicitly define or declare your caches in some manner. This is
inconvenient since you have basically already declared the caches
required by your application when using Spring’s, or alternatively, the
JSR-107, JCache API annotations (e.g. `@Cacheable`). Why should you have
to do this again? Well, using [spring-boot-gemfire-name], you don’t. You simply have to
declare the `@EnableCachingDefinedRegions` annotation and [spring-boot-gemfire-name] will take
care of defining the necessary [vmware-gemfire-name] Regions backing the caches
for you.

Regions for caches are not auto-configured for you because there are
many different ways to "define" a Region, with different configuration,
such as eviction and expiration polices, memory requirements,
application callbacks, etc. The Region may already exist and have been
created some other way. Either way, you may not want [spring-boot-gemfire-name] to
auto-configure these Regions for you.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong>
If you have not done so already, you should
definitely read about [spring-boot-gemfire-name]’s support for <em>Inline Caching</em> in the
<a href="../index.html#geode-caching-provider-inline-caching">Inline
Caching</a> section.

### Backend DataSource Configuration

While we used Spring Data’s Repository abstraction as the way to access
data in the backend data store used for *Inline Caching*, we have not
shown how the data source for the backend data store was configured.

Obviously, the data source connecting the application to the backend
data store varies from data store to data store. Clearly, when using a
database, you would configure a `javax.sql.DataSource` using the JDBC
API. That `DataSource` is then plugged into a higher-level data access
API like JDBC, or Spring’s `JdbcTemplate`, or JPA, to perform data
access. With MongoDB or Redis, again you would configure the data
source, or connection factory, appropriate for those stores and plug
that into the data access API of your choice (e.g. Spring Data MongoDB
or Spring Data Redis).

Though it is not immediately apparent in our example, we simply 1) used
an embedded, in-memory database (i.e. HSQLDB) and 2) relied on Spring
Boot’s *auto-configuration* to bootstrap the embedded database on
startup.

To learn more about <a
href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-sql.html#boot-features-embedded-database-support">bootstrapping</a>
an embedded database and the embedded databases that can be
<em>auto-configured</em> by Spring Boot, follow the link.

In a nutshell, we only need to declare a dependency on `spring-jdbc` and
the embedded database we want to use as the backend data store for
*Inline Caching*, like so:

Dependencies declaration

``` highlight
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-data-jpa</artifactId>
  </dependency>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>org.hsqldb</groupId>
    <artifactId>hsqldb</artifactId>
    <scope>runtime</scope>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

The `spring-jdbc` dependency is transitively pulled in by
`org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-data-jpa`, which also
pulls in Spring Data JPA. Therefore, we are using JPA, and specifically,
the Hibernate JPA provider, to back our Spring Data Repository (i.e.
`CalculatorRepository`) in this example.

With these dependencies declared on the application’s classpath, Spring
Boot *auto-configures* a `DataSource` to an embedded HSQLDB database,
bootstraps HSQLDB, finds our application `CalculatorRepository`
interface declaration, and backs it with a Spring Data JPA
implementation using Hibernate as the provider. Very powerful!

Additionally, we configure our embedded HSQLDB database by including a
SQL script with DDL statements to initialize the schema (i.e. create the
"CALCULATIONS" table):

schema.sql

``` highlight
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS calculations (
    operand INTEGER NOT NULL,
    operator VARCHAR(256) NOT NULL,
    result INTEGER NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (operand, operator)
);
```

We also include a SQL script containing DML statements to populate the
database with some existing data (i.e. mathematical calculations) in
order to simulate cache hits:

data.sql

``` highlight
INSERT INTO calculations (operand, operator, result) VALUES (5, 'FACTORIAL', 120);
INSERT INTO calculations (operand, operator, result) VALUES (7, 'FACTORIAL', 5040);
INSERT INTO calculations (operand, operator, result) VALUES (9, 'FACTORIAL', 362880);
INSERT INTO calculations (operand, operator, result) VALUES (16, 'SQUARE_ROOT', 4);
INSERT INTO calculations (operand, operator, result) VALUES (64, 'SQUARE_ROOT', 8);
INSERT INTO calculations (operand, operator, result) VALUES (256, 'SQUARE_ROOT', 16);
```

By simply including `schema.sql` and the complimentary `data.sql` files
in the classpath of the application, Spring Boot will automatically
detect these files and apply them to the database during startup.

To learn more about embedded, in-memory database
initialization applied by Spring Boot, see <a
href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/howto-database-initialization.html">here</a>.

### Application and Data Modeling

The final component of our application up for discussion is the
application domain model (as compared to the data model). There is not a
whole lot of difference; the structure and mapping is relatively 1-to-1.

The results from the mathematical calculations are captured in an
instance of the `ResultHolder` class:

CalculatorRepository

``` highlight
@Entity
@Getter
@IdClass(ResultHolder.ResultKey.class)
@EqualsAndHashCode(of = { "operand", "operator" })
@RequiredArgsConstructor(staticName = "of")
@Table(name = "Calculations")
public class ResultHolder implements Serializable {

    @Id @NonNull
    private Integer operand;

    @Id
    @NonNull
    @Enumerated(EnumType.STRING)
    private Operator operator;

    @NonNull
    private Integer result;

    protected ResultHolder() { }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return getOperator().toString(getOperand(), getResult());
    }

    @Getter
    @EqualsAndHashCode
    @RequiredArgsConstructor(staticName = "of")
    public static class ResultKey implements Serializable {

        @NonNull
        private Integer operand;

        @NonNull
        private Operator operator;

        protected ResultKey() { }

    }
}
```

This class uses [Project Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/) to simplify
the implementation.

It is also a JPA persistent entity as designated by the
`javax.persistence.Entity` annotation.

We also define a composite, primary key (i.e. `ResultHolder.ResultKey`),
which consists of the `operand` to the mathematical function along with
the `Operator`, which has been defined as an enumerated type and is the
mathematical function being computed (e.g. *factorial*).

This is also why, as briefly alluded to back in the section on [Inline
Caching
Configuration](#geode-samples-caching-inline-example-calculator-configuration),
the `resultKeyGenerator` bean definition was important:

Result KeyGenerator bean definition

``` highlight
    @Bean
    KeyGenerator resultKeyGenerator() {

        return (target, method, arguments) -> {

            int operand = Integer.parseInt(String.valueOf(arguments[0]));

            Operator operator = "sqrt".equals(method.getName())
                ? Operator.SQUARE_ROOT
                : Operator.FACTORIAL;

            return ResultHolder.ResultKey.of(operand, operator);
        };
    }
```

This custom `KeyGenerator` was applied in the caching annotations of the
service method like so:

Result KeyGenerator use

``` highlight
@Service
class CalculatorService {

  @Cacheable(keyGenerator="resultKeyGenerator")
  public int factorial(int number) {  }

}
```

Basically, the keys between the cache and the database (i.e. the primary
key) must match. This is because the cache key is used as the identifier
in all data access operations performed against the backend database
using the `CalculatorRepository` (e.g.
`calculatorRepository.findById(cacheEntry.getKey())`, specifically in
the cache loader’s (i.e. the *read-through*) case).

If a custom `KeyGenerator` had not been provided, then the "key" would
have been the `@Cacheable` service method parameter only (i.e. the
integer number or operand in the mathematical function), and as I
already stated, the primary key in the database table is a composite key
consisting of both the operand and the operator. This was deliberate
because…​

The most fundamental difference between the application domain model and
the database model is that while the application keeps the mathematical
calculations in 2 separate, distinct caches (Regions), as seen in the
\`@Cacheable annotation on the individual service methods:

Declared caches

``` highlight
@Service
class CalculatorService {

  @Cacheable(name = "Factorials")
  public int factorial(int number) {  }

  @Cacheable(name = "SquareRoots")
  public int sqrt(int number) {  }

}
```

The database, on the other hand, stores all mathematical calculations in
the same table. That is, both *factorials* and *square roots* are stored
together in the "CALCULATIONS" table.

This is also why the `operand` cannot be used as the primary key by
itself. If a user of our Calculator application performed both
`factorial(4) = 24` and `sqrt(4) = 2`, how do we know which result the
user wants just by looking at the operand when performing the cache
lookup. You dons’t. You need to know the `operator`, too.

While the individual `CalculatorService` methods for the mathematical
functions determine which `operator` is in play, and even while the
results of the calculations are kept separately in distinct caches, and
therefore, there can only be one result per entry (i.e. `operand`) in
the individual caches, the database table is not like the cache or the
application.

Again, this design was very deliberate in order to show the flexibility
you have in modeling your application, your cache and your database,
independently of each other. After all, you may be building a new
application for an existing database who’s data model cannot be changed.
However, it does not mean your application model needs to strictly match
the database model if that is not the most efficient way to access and
process the data.

The point is, you have options, and you can make the best choice for
your application’s needs.

## Run the Example

Now it is time to run the example.

The example can be run from the command-line using the `gradlew` command
as follows:

Running the example with `gradlew`

``` highlight
$ gradlew :spring-geode-samples-caching-inline:bootRun
```

Alternatively, you can run the `BootGeodeInlineCachingApplication` class
in your IDE (e.g. IntelliJ IDEA). Simply create a run profile
configuration and run it. No additional JVM arguments, System Properties
or program arguments are required.

<p class="important"><strong>Important:</strong>
The observant reader will have noticed that the
<code>CalculatorService</code> uses <code>int</code> as the data type
for the input and output of the mathematical functions. You should never
use <code>int</code> to implement any mathematical calculations for any
enterprise applications, ever. Instead, you should use either
<code>java.math.BigDecimal</code> or <code>java.math.BitInteger</code>.
One of many reasons for this, especially in <em>factorial’s</em> case,
is that it is very easy to "<em>overflow</em>" the allowed values of an
<code>int</code> type, which is 32 bits. In fact, with
<code>factorial(13)</code> you exceed the range of allowed integer
values represented by an <code>int</code>. Even <code>long</code> is not
sufficient in most cases. Therefore, the <code>CalculatorService</code>
is very limited in its utility. <code>int</code> was used primarily to
minimize type conversions between store types and keep the example as
simple as possible.

The Calculator application includes a `CalculatorController`, which is a
Spring Web MVC `@RestController`, containing the following Web service
endpoints:

<table class="tableblock frame-all grid-all stretch">
<caption>Table 1. Calculator Web Service Endpoints</caption>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 50%" />
<col style="width: 50%" />

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Keep in mind that the following data set has been loaded into the
backend database already, which is indirectly treated as "cached" data:

data.sql

``` highlight
INSERT INTO calculations (operand, operator, result) VALUES (5, 'FACTORIAL', 120);
INSERT INTO calculations (operand, operator, result) VALUES (7, 'FACTORIAL', 5040);
INSERT INTO calculations (operand, operator, result) VALUES (9, 'FACTORIAL', 362880);
INSERT INTO calculations (operand, operator, result) VALUES (16, 'SQUARE_ROOT', 4);
INSERT INTO calculations (operand, operator, result) VALUES (64, 'SQUARE_ROOT', 8);
INSERT INTO calculations (operand, operator, result) VALUES (256, 'SQUARE_ROOT', 16);
```

If you call <a href="http://localhost:8080/caculator/factorial/4"
class="bare"><code>http://localhost:8080/caculator/factorial/4</code></a>,
you will see the following output:

![factorial of four before](./images/factorial-of-four-before.png)

The output shows the result of `factorial(4)` is **24**, that the
calculation took **3096 *milliseconds*** and the operation resulted in a
***cache miss***. However, now that we computed `factorial(4)`, the
result was put into the "cache" as well as INSERTED into the backend
(embedded, in-memory HSQLDB) database. So, if we run the operation
again, the `latency` drops to zero (and ***cacheMiss*** is ***false***):

![factorial of four after](./images/factorial-of-four-after.png)

That is because the result (i.e. **24**) of `factorial(4)` is "cached"
in [vmware-gemfire-name] (as well as persisted to the database;
*write-through*) and therefore, the `CaculatorService.factorial(:int)`
method is **not** called. The result, however, is pulled from the cache,
not the database.

To see the effects of the `factorial(:int)` method involving the
database as part of the inline cache lookup, you can call
<a href="http://localhost:8080/caculator/factorial/5"
class="bare"><code>http://localhost:8080/caculator/factorial/5</code></a>.
**5** is stored in the database, but is not currently present in the
cache:

![factorial of five before](./images/factorial-of-five-before.png)

While the latency is much better than invoking the *factorial* function,
it is still not as fast as pulling the result from the cache.

Now, if you hit refresh in your browser, the application will get the
result of `factorial(5)` from the cache since the result was loaded from
the database and put into the cache (*read-through*) during the first
request. Therefore, we see that the latency drops from **12 ms** to **0
ms**. However, in both cases, the ***cacheMiss*** was ***false***
because the value was found (in the database) without invoking the
`CalculatorService.factorial(:int)` method:

![factorial of five after](./images/factorial-of-five-after.png)

You can play around with the *square root* operation to see the same
effects of *Inline Caching*.


## Tests

The Calculator application includes an Integration Test class with tests
asserting the behavior demonstrated above in the example. The test class
is available here:

<a
href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot-data-geode/spring-geode-samples/caching/inline/src/test/java/example/app/caching/inline/CalculatorApplicationIntegrationTests.java"
class="bare">https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot-data-geode/spring-geode-samples/caching/inline/src/test/java/example/app/caching/inline/CalculatorApplicationIntegrationTests.java</a>


## Summary

*Inline Caching* is a powerful caching pattern when you have an
external, backend data store that doubles as the application’s *System
of Record* (SOR) and you need to keep the cache and database relatively
in-sync with each other.

*Inline Caching* enables immediate *read-through* and *write-through*
behavior that keeps the cache and database consistent. While the
database can serve as a fallback option for priming the cache, the cache
will serve an important role in reducing the contention and load on the
backend database.

As you have seen in this guide, the configuration of *Inline Caching* is
very simple to do with [spring-boot-gemfire-name] when using
Spring’s Cache Abstraction along with [vmware-gemfire-name] as the caching
provider.
