This guide walks through using
[Spring Boot Actuator](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/production-ready.html) to
assess the state of your running [vmware-gemfire-name], Spring Boot application.


The goal for [spring-boot-gemfire-name]’s Spring Boot Actuator integration is to enable users
to effectively manage and monitor their Spring Boot applications using
[vmware-gemfire-name] in a production environment.

In particular, [spring-boot-gemfire-name]’s integration with Spring Boot Actuator currently focuses on enabling [Health
Information](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/production-ready-endpoints.html#production-ready-health)
for your application. In the future, [spring-boot-gemfire-name] will provide dedicated support for
[Micrometer](https://micrometer.io/) metrics.

This guide assumes you are already familiar with Spring Boot and
[vmware-gemfire-name].

Refer to the <a href="../index.html#actuator">Spring
Boot Actuator</a> chapter in the reference documentation for more
information.

## Example Application

This guide additionally provides a working
[example application](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot-data-geode/spring-geode-samples/boot/actuator) to review some of the Actuator Health Endpoints.

The example application is a simple Temperature Monitoring Service,
simulating a real-world, Internet of Things (IOT) Use Case (UC).
Essentially, the application collects temperature readings from
different temperature sensors (devices) and uses the readings to monitor
fluctuations in temperatures so that someone or something can respond
accordingly. The sensor devices could be located around the world in
multiple locations in the planet’s oceans.

### TemperatureReading

First, we start by modeling a temperature reading, which stores the
temperature in Fahrenheit along with a timestamp for when the reading
was measured.

Clearly, a more practical example would store the temperature
measurement as a `double` or `BigDecimal` along with the ability to
support different scales (Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin).

However in this case, we simply model the `TemperatureReading` as:

TemperatureReading class

``` highlight
@Data
@Region("TemperatureReadings")
@RequiredArgsConstructor(staticName = "newTemperatureReading")
@SuppressWarnings("unused")
public class TemperatureReading {

    private static final int BOILING_TEMPERATURE = 212;
    private static final int FREEZING_TEMPERATURE = 32;

    @Id
    private Long timestamp = System.currentTimeMillis();

    @NonNull
    private final Integer temperature;

    @Transient
    public boolean isBoiling() {

        Integer temperature = getTemperature();

        return temperature != null && temperature >= BOILING_TEMPERATURE;
    }

    @Transient
    public boolean isFreezing() {

        Integer temperature = getTemperature();

        return temperature != null && temperature <= FREEZING_TEMPERATURE;
    }

    @Transient
    public boolean isNormal() {
        return !(isBoiling() || isFreezing());
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return String.format("%d °F", getTemperature());
    }
}
```

The `TemperatureReading` class is annotated with SDG’s `@Region` mapping
annotation to declare the [vmware-gemfire-name] Region in which
`TemperatureReadings` will be persisted.


### TemperatureEvent

A key concern of our application is to "monitor" temperature readings.
Therefore, we need some way to capture temperature change events.


For that, we introduce the simple `TemperatureEvent` base class:

TemperatureEvent class


``` highlight
public class TemperatureEvent extends ApplicationEvent {

    @Getter
    private final TemperatureReading temperatureReading;

    public TemperatureEvent(Object source, TemperatureReading temperatureReading) {

        super(source);

        this.temperatureReading = temperatureReading;
    }
}
```


`TemperatureEvent` is a Spring `ApplicationEvent` capable of being
published to to Spring `@EventListeners` registered in the Spring
application context.

Additionally, we provide 2 subclasses: `BoilingTemperatureEvent` and
`FreezingTemperatureEvent` to further classify temperature changes.


### TemperatureReadingRepository

To perform basic data access operations (e.g. CRUD) and simple queries
on `TemperatureReadings`, we create a Spring Data *Repository*:

TemperatureReadingRepository interface

``` highlight
public interface TemperatureReadingRepository extends CrudRepository<TemperatureReading, Long> {

    List<TemperatureReading> findByTimestampGreaterThanAndTimestampLessThan(
        Long timestampLowerBound, Long timestampUpperBound);

    @Query("SELECT count(*) FROM /TemperatureReadings WHERE temperature >= 212")
    Integer countBoilingTemperatureReadings();

    @Query("SELECT count(*) FROM /TemperatureReadings WHERE temperature <= 32")
    Integer countFreezingTemperatureReadings();

}
```

The *Repository* showcases a an example, derived query methods,
`findByTimestampGreaterThanAndTimestampLessThan(..)` along with 2
`@Query` annotated query methods using raw OQL queries.


### TemperatureMonitor service class


To receive temperature change events, we need a class to monitor
changes. This capability is built on [vmware-gemfire-name]'s
[Continuous Query (CQ)](https://geode.apache.org/docs/guide/1.15/developing/continuous_querying/chapter_overview.html) functionality.


With [vmware-gemfire-name] you can register an (OQL) Query with the servers in
the cluster that runs continuously, sending notifications back to the
client anytime data changes to match the predicate in our query, or
queries.

For our purposes, we will simply monitor the temperature anytime it
rises above boiling (212 °F) or drops below freezing (32 °F):


TemperatureMonitor class



``` highlight
@Service
@SuppressWarnings("unused")
public class TemperatureMonitor {

    private final ApplicationEventPublisher applicationEventPublisher;

    public TemperatureMonitor(ApplicationEventPublisher applicationEventPublisher) {

        Assert.notNull(applicationEventPublisher, "ApplicationEventPublisher is required");

        this.applicationEventPublisher = applicationEventPublisher;
    }

    @ContinuousQuery(name = "BoilingTemperatureMonitor",
        query = "SELECT * FROM /TemperatureReadings WHERE temperature >= 212")
    public void boilingTemperatureReadings(CqEvent event) {

        Optional.ofNullable(event)
            .map(CqEvent::getNewValue)
            .filter(TemperatureReading.class::isInstance)
            .map(TemperatureReading.class::cast)
            .map(it -> new BoilingTemperatureEvent(this, it))
            .ifPresent(this.applicationEventPublisher::publishEvent);
    }

    @ContinuousQuery(name = "FreezingTemperatureMonitor",
        query = "SELECT * FROM /TemperatureReadings WHERE temperature <= 32")
    public void freezingTemperatureReadings(CqEvent event) {

        Optional.ofNullable(event)
            .map(CqEvent::getNewValue)
            .filter(TemperatureReading.class::isInstance)
            .map(TemperatureReading.class::cast)
            .map(it -> new FreezingTemperatureEvent(this, it))
            .ifPresent(this.applicationEventPublisher::publishEvent);
    }
}
```


When the temperature changes, triggering our queries, we receive an
event and publish an appropriate `TemperatureEvent` by using the Spring
container’s `ApplicationEventPublisher`, which has been injected into
the monitor class.


The 2 OQL queries have been defined to query the "TemperatureReadings"
Region and fire anytime the temperature rises is above boiling (212 °F)
or drops below freezing (32 °F).


### TemperatureSensor service class

Of course, we need a simulator to generate temperatures.


For that we have the `TemperatureSensor` class:

TemperatureSensor class


``` highlight
@Service
@SuppressWarnings("unused")
public class TemperatureSensor {

    private final PrimitiveIterator.OfInt temperatureStream =
        new Random(System.currentTimeMillis())
            .ints(-100, 400)
            .iterator();

    private final TemperatureReadingRepository repository;

    public TemperatureSensor(TemperatureReadingRepository repository) {

        Assert.notNull(repository, "TemperatureReadingRepository is required");

        this.repository = repository;
    }

    @Scheduled(fixedRateString = "${example.app.temp.sensor.reading.schedule.rate:1000}")
    public void readTemperature() {

        TemperatureReading temperatureReading =
            TemperatureReading.newTemperatureReading(temperatureStream.nextInt());

        this.repository.save(log(temperatureReading));
    }

    private TemperatureReading log(TemperatureReading temperatureReading) {

        PrintStream out = temperatureReading.isNormal() ? System.out : System.err;

        out.printf("TEMPERATURE READING [%s]%n", temperatureReading);

        return temperatureReading;
    }
}
```

To generate a stream of temperatures, we use Spring’s
[Scheduling Service](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/integration.html#scheduling) along with a `Random` stream of `ints` provided via an
`Iterator`, as seen in the `readTemperature()` method.

The `readTemperature()` method is then storing the **new**
`TemperatureReading` in the "TemperatureReadings" Region as designated
by our `TemperatureReading` model class’s, `@Region` annotation
declaration:


@Region declaration


``` highlight
@Region("TemperatureReadings")
public class TemperatureReading {  }
```


Additionally, the `readTempeature()` method uses our
`TemperatureReadingRepository` to perform the necessary data access
operations.


### Server

Now, we need a couple of main application classes to actually have the
application do something useful.

We start with an Spring Boot, [vmware-gemfire-name] Server application
functioning as the temperature sensor (device) using the
`TemperatureSensor` class:

BootGeodeServerApplication main class

``` highlight
@SpringBootApplication
@CacheServerApplication(name = "TemperatureServiceServer")
@EnableEntityDefinedRegions(basePackageClasses = TemperatureReading.class)
@EnableGemfireRepositories(basePackageClasses = TemperatureReadingRepository.class)
@EnableScheduling
@EnableStatistics
@UseGroups("TemperatureSensors")
@SuppressWarnings("unused")
public class BootGeodeServerApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        new SpringApplicationBuilder(BootGeodeServerApplication.class)
            .web(WebApplicationType.SERVLET)
            .build()
            .run(args);
    }

    @Bean
    TemperatureSensor temperatureSensor(TemperatureReadingRepository repository) {
        return new TemperatureSensor(repository);
    }

    @Bean
    RegionConfigurer temperatureReadingsConfigurer() {

        return new RegionConfigurer() {

            @Override
            public void configure(String beanName, PeerRegionFactoryBean<?, ?> regionBean) {

                Optional.ofNullable(beanName)
                    .filter("TemperatureReadings"::equals)
                    .ifPresent(it -> regionBean.setStatisticsEnabled(true));
            }
        };
    }

    @Bean
    @DependsOn("TemperatureReadings")
    IndexFactoryBean temperatureReadingTemperatureIndex(GemFireCache gemfireCache) {

        IndexFactoryBean temperatureTimestampIndex = new IndexFactoryBean();

        temperatureTimestampIndex.setCache(gemfireCache);
        temperatureTimestampIndex.setExpression("temperature");
        temperatureTimestampIndex.setFrom("/TemperatureReadings");
        temperatureTimestampIndex.setName("TemperatureReadingTemperatureIdx");

        return temperatureTimestampIndex;
    }

    @Bean
    @DependsOn("TemperatureReadings")
    IndexFactoryBean temperatureReadingTimestampIndex(GemFireCache gemfireCache) {

        IndexFactoryBean temperatureTimestampIndex = new IndexFactoryBean();

        temperatureTimestampIndex.setCache(gemfireCache);
        temperatureTimestampIndex.setExpression("timestamp");
        temperatureTimestampIndex.setFrom("/TemperatureReadings");
        temperatureTimestampIndex.setName("TemperatureReadingTimestampIdx");

        return temperatureTimestampIndex;
    }
}
```

This class is annotated with `@SpringBootApplication` making it a proper
Spring Boot application. It uses Spring Boot’s
`SpringApplicationBuilder` to configure and bootstrap the server
application.

This class is also annotated with SDG’s `@CacheServerApplication` making
it a proper [vmware-gemfire-name] Server with a peer `Cache` instance along with
a `CacheServer` to accept client connections. This effectively overrides
[spring-boot-gemfire-name]’s default `ClientCache` instance.

Additionally, the class enables several other features, such as Spring’s
*Scheduling Service*, [vmware-gemfire-name] Statistics, and entity-defined
Regions making the creation of our server-side, partitioned
"TemperatureReadings" Region simple.

By enabling [vmware-gemfire-name] statistics, we allow Spring Boot’s Actuator,
`HealthIndicators` to collect metrics about our running [vmware-gemfire-name]
Server as well.

Because we have enabled scheduling (with `@EnableScheduling`) and
declared the `TemperatureSensor` class as a bean in the Spring
application context, the application will immediately start generating
temperature readings, which are recorded to the "TemperatureReadings"
Region.

Finally, our class registers a couple [vmware-gemfire-name] Region Indexes to
make the Actuator `HealthIndicator` information more interesting,
particularly since we are running continuous queries.

This is a Servlet-based application as well since our Actuator,
`HealthIndicator` endpoints are exposed via HTTP.

There are multiple ways to configure and bootstrap
an [vmware-gemfire-name] Server, and the server-side of our application. Using
Spring Boot is one of the easier ways.

### Client

Next, we need a client functioning as the "monitor" in our Temperature
Service application.

BootGeodeClientApplication main class

``` highlight
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableClusterAware
@EnableEntityDefinedRegions(basePackageClasses = TemperatureReading.class)
@UseGroups("TemperatureMonitors")
@UseMemberName("TemperatureMonitoringService")
@SuppressWarnings("unused")
public class BootGeodeClientApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        new SpringApplicationBuilder(BootGeodeClientApplication.class)
            .web(WebApplicationType.SERVLET)
            .build()
            .run(args);
    }

    @Bean
    TemperatureMonitor temperatureMonitor(ApplicationEventPublisher applicationEventPublisher) {
        return new TemperatureMonitor(applicationEventPublisher);
    }

    @EventListener(classes = { BoilingTemperatureEvent.class, FreezingTemperatureEvent.class })
    public void temperatureEventHandler(TemperatureEvent temperatureEvent) {

        System.err.printf("%1$s TEMPERATURE READING [%2$s]%n",
            temperatureEvent instanceof BoilingTemperatureEvent ? "HOT" : "COLD",
                temperatureEvent.getTemperatureReading());
    }
}
```

Again, this class is also annotated with `@SpringBootApplication` making
it a proper Spring Boot application. It too uses Spring Boot’s
`SpringApplicationBuilder` class to configure and bootstrap the client
application.

Unlike our server, this class is not annotated with any [spring-data-gemfire-name]
`@*Cache*Application` annotations since [spring-boot-gemfire-name] provides us a `ClientCache`
instance by default. We want this application to be a client in our
setup.

Like our server, we enable entity-defined Regions to easily and quickly
create the client `PROXY` Region for "TemperatureReadings", which will
send/receive data to/from the server-side Region by the same name.

And, like our server application, we declare a bean of type
`TemperatureMonitor` in the Spring application context to receive the
`TemperatureReading` events. This enables the CQ registration and event
handlers to sets things in motion.

Probably the most interesting part is that we an `@EventListener` to
receive the `TemperatureEvents` to log the `TemperatureReadings` to
`System.err`.

## Run the Example

It is time to run the example.

First, we need to start the server.

You can run the server from your IDE (e.g. IntelliJ IDEA) by creating a
run profile configuration for the
`example.app.temp.geode.server.BootGeodeServerApplication` class. Make
sure to set the JVM argument to activate the "*server*" Spring Profile:
`-Dspring.profiles.active=server`.

Alternatively, you can run the server from the command-line using the
`gradlew` command:

`$ gradlew :spring-geode-samples-boot-actuator:runServer`

The `gradlew` command and `runServer` Gradle Task sets the configuration
(e.g. Spring Profile) for you. The `gradlew` command is ran in the
directory where you cloned the `spring-boot-data-geode` project (**not**
in `spring-boot-data-geode/spring-geode-samples/boot/actuator/`).

If you wish to adjust the log levels of [vmware-gemfire-name] or Spring Boot
while running the client and server applications, then you can set the
log levels of the individual Loggers (i.e. `org.apache` and
`org.springframework`) in `src/main/resources/logback.xml`:

spring-geode-samples/boot/actuator/src/main/resources/logback.xml

``` highlight
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<configuration debug="false">

    <statusListener class="ch.qos.logback.core.status.NopStatusListener"/>

    <appender name="console" class="ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender">
        <encoder>
            <pattern>%d %5p %40.40c:%4L - %m%n</pattern>
        </encoder>
    </appender>

    <logger name="ch.qos.logback" level="${logback.log.level:-ERROR}"/>

    <logger name="org.apache" level="${logback.log.level:-ERROR}"/>

    <logger name="org.springframework" level="${logback.log.level:-ERROR}"/>

    <root level="${logback.log.level:-ERROR}">
        <appender-ref ref="console"/>
    </root>

</configuration>
```

Running the server from your IDE:

Run the server

``` highlight
/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_192.jdk/Contents/Home/bin/java -server -ea -Dspring.profiles.active=server
  ... example.app.temp.geode.server.BootGeodeServerApplication

  .   ____          _            __ _ _
 /\\ / ___'_ __ _ _(_)_ __  __ _ \ \ \ \

  '  |____| .__|_| |_|_| |_\__, | / / / /
 =========|_|==============|___/=/_/_/_/
 :: Spring Boot ::        (v2.0.9.RELEASE)

TEMPERATURE READING [99 °F]
TEMPERATURE READING [-17 °F]
TEMPERATURE READING [67 °F]
TEMPERATURE READING [9 °F]
TEMPERATURE READING [102 °F]
TEMPERATURE READING [10 °F]
...
```

After the server starts and begins to log temperature readings (as shown
above), then start the client.

The client can be ran in the same manner as the server, from your IDE or
from the command-line using `gradlew`.

To run the client in your IDE (e.g. IntelliJ IDEA) then create a run
profile configuration for the
`example.app.temp.geode.client.BootGeodeClientApplication` and set the
JVM argument to activate the "*client*" Spring Profile:
\`-Dspring.profiles.active=client".

Alternatively, you can run the client from the command-line using the
following command:

`$ gradlew :spring-geode-samples-boot-actuator:bootRun`

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong>
The client must be run in a separate terminal,
unless you ran the server as a background process with the
<code>&amp;</code> on Linux/UNIX based systems. See <a
href="https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-run-linux-commands-in-background/">here</a>
for more details.

Running the client from your IDE:

COLD TEMPERATURE READING [-82 °F]
HOT TEMPERATURE READING [295 °F]
HOT TEMPERATURE READING [326 °F]
HOT TEMPERATURE READING [378 °F]
COLD TEMPERATURE READING [-4 °F]
...
```

You should only see boiling and freezing temperatures logged to the
client’s console. This is because our client only "monitors" and logs
temperature readings above or below a certain threshold
(boiling/freezing), as defined by the Continuous Queries (CQ).

Both the server and client will continue to run, generating and logging
temperatures, until you stop the JVM processes.



## Monitoring our Example with Spring Boot Actuator, HealthIndicator Endpoints

After the application has been running for some time, we can inspect the
Spring Boot Actuator, HealthIndicator Endpoints provided by [spring-boot-gemfire-name] to
monitor our application’s health and runtime performance in addition to
basic configuration meta-data used to configure [vmware-gemfire-name] at runtime.

### Client Health Information

To navigate to the client applications Actuator Health endpoints, open a
Web Browser (e.g. Google Chrome) to:

<a href="http://localhost:9191/actuator/health"
class="bare"><code>http://localhost:9191/actuator/health</code></a>

This will output a JSON document similar to:

![client actuator health
endpoints](./images/client-actuator-health-endpoints.png)

We can see details on our client "TemperatureReadings" Region:

![client actuator health region
endpoint](./images/client-actuator-health-region-endpoint.png)

As well as our CQs:

![client actuator health cq
endpoint](./images/client-actuator-health-cq-endpoint.png)

When you hit refresh, the metrics will update.

### Server Health Information

To navigate to the server applications Actuator Health endpoint, open a
Web Browser (e.g. Google Chrome) to:

<a href="http://localhost:8181/actuator/health"
class="bare"><code>http://localhost:8181/actuator/health</code></a>

This will output a JSON document similar to:

![server actuator health
endpoints](./images/server-actuator-health-endpoints.png)

We can see details of the server "TemperatureReadings" Region:

![server actuator health region
endpoint](./images/server-actuator-health-region-endpoint.png)

As well as our Indexes:

![server actuator health indexes
endpoint](./images/server-actuator-health-indexes-endpoint.png)

And our CacheServer serving clients:

![server actuator health cacheserver
endpoint](./images/server-actuator-health-cacheserver-endpoint.png)

When you hit refresh, the metrics will update.

## Enabling Spring Boot Actuator

All of this was made possible by including the following dependency on
our application classpath:

Maven POM

``` highlight
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.geode</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-geode-starter-actuator</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

Additionally, in Spring Boot `application.properties`, you must enable
the following:

Spring Boot `application.properties`

``` highlight
management.endpoint.health.show-details=always
```

## Conclusion

Hopefully this guide has shown you how to use the Spring Boot Actuator
feature for [vmware-gemfire-name].
