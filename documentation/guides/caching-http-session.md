This guide walks you through building a simple Spring Boot application
using [Spring Session](https://spring.io/projects/spring-session) backed
by [[vmware-gemfire-name]](https://www.vmware.com/products/gemfire.html) to manage HTTP Session
state.

It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the Spring *programming
model* as well as the *Java Servlet* API. No prior knowledge of Spring
Session or [vmware-gemfire-name] is required to utilize HTTP Session State
Caching in your Spring Boot applications.

Let’s begin.

Refer to the <a
href="../index.html#geode-session">Spring Session</a> chapter in the
reference documentation for more information.


## Background

HTTP Session Caching is one of the most used forms of caching in
enterprise applications, especially given the proliferation of Web
applications in the enterprise.

HTTP Sessions are primarily used to manage conversational state with
users of your Web applications between HTTP requests given that HTTP is
a stateless protocol. This is due to the fact that HTTP connections are
not persistent. When an HTTP client makes a request, the client opens a
connection to the server, sends an HTTP request, waits for the server to
process the request and respond, and then closes the connection. Each
time an HTTP request is sent, the same procedure is followed.

Of course, there are alternatives to HTTP when making remote Web Service
requests. For instance, if you are using
[WebSockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket) in your
applications, then you would have persistent connections and would most
likely be using either the [STOMP](https://stomp.github.io/) or
[WAMP](https://wamp-proto.org/) protocols.

<tableThe core Spring Framework has <a
href="[spring-framework-docs]/web.html#websocket">first-class
support</a> for <em>WebSockets</em> over the STOMP protocol.

Spring Session additionally <a
href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-session/reference/guides/boot-websocket.html">supports</a>
Session State Management for <em>WebSockets</em>.

As mentioned above, it is useful to use the HTTP Session to manage
conversational state with users of your applications so that they can
experience continuity between separate interactions (i.e. HTTP
requests). In order to maintain that continuity and provide a
consistent, uninterrupted experience, the HTTP Session must be preserved
in a reliable manner.

One way to do this is to employ a data management solution in your
application architecture that 1) makes the HTTP Session highly available
and 2) makes the HTTP Session resilient to failures in the system
architecture.

[vmware-gemfire-name] is ideal for managing HTTP Session state given that it
can distribute data/state across a scaled-out, highly-available
architecture by replicating data in a redundant and organized
(partitioned) manner, thereby making the data resilient to network and
hardware failures.

This is ideal in a cloud environment given that you will most likely be
running multiple instances of your application in order to serve the
demand, especially during peak loads. In these cases, you will
undoubtedly face failures and each application instance will need to be
prepared to take over in a moments notice to provide the consistent,
uninterrupted experience to which we alluded to above. These
applications instances will need access to the same HTTP Session state.

An application architecture with HTTP Session State Caching appears as
follows:

![HTTP Session Caching](./images/HTTP-Session-Caching.png)

Essentially, anytime an HTTP Session is requested by your Spring Boot,
Web Application, the Servlet Container (e.g. Apache Tomcat) delegates to
Spring Session to provide the implementation of
`javax.servlet.http.HttpSession`. After all,
`javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet` is an interface that can have many
implementations.

Effectively, Spring Session provides it’s own implementation of the
`javax.servlet.http.HttpSession` interface through a Servlet `Filter`
that gets registered by Spring Session programmatically when Spring
Session is on the application classpath.

Spring Session’s implementation of the `javax.servlet.http.HttpSession`
interface can backed by many different providers that implement the
Spring Session framework’s `SessionRepository` interface.

Spring Session’s architecture can be depicted as follows:

![Spring Session Framework
Architecture](./images/Spring-Session-Framework-Architecture.png)

Again, the `SessionRepository` interface is the central component of the
framework enabling any backend data store to be adapted and serve as a
provider for managing the HTTP Sessions.

This is effectively how [[spring-session-gemfire-name]](https://github.com/gemfire/spring-session-for-vmware-gemfire)
works.


## Example

For our example, we are going to keep the Web application relatively
simple. Essentially, we just want to show you how easy it is to use
Spring Session in your Spring Boot, Web applications, to manage the HTTP
Session state.

So, we are going to switch from Servlet Container (e.g. Apache Tomcat)
to Spring Session managed HTTP Sessions with a single-line configuration
change.

First, let’s introduce the Spring Web MVC `Controller` in our Spring
Boot, Web application.

### Controller

Our Spring Web MVC `Controller` class is implemented as follows:

Spring Boot, Web Application Controller

``` highlight
@Controller
public class CounterController {

    public static final String INDEX_TEMPLATE_VIEW_NAME = "index";

    private final Set<String> sessionIds = Collections.synchronizedSet(new HashSet<>());

    @GetMapping("/")
    @ResponseBody
    public String home() {
        return format("HTTP Session Caching Example");
    }

    @GetMapping("/ping")
    @ResponseBody
    public String ping() {
        return format("PONG");
    }

    @GetMapping("/session")
    public ModelAndView sessionRequestCounts(HttpSession session) {

        this.sessionIds.add(session.getId());

        Map<String, Object> model = new HashMap<>();

        model.put("sessionType", session.getClass().getName());
        model.put("sessionCount", this.sessionIds.size());
        model.put("requestCount", getRequestCount(session));

        return new ModelAndView(INDEX_TEMPLATE_VIEW_NAME, model);
    }

    private Object getRequestCount(HttpSession session) {

        Integer requestCount = (Integer) session.getAttribute("requestCount");

        requestCount = requestCount != null ? requestCount : 0;
        requestCount++;

        session.setAttribute("requestCount", requestCount);

        return requestCount;
    }

    private String format(String value) {
        return String.format("<h1>%s</h1>", value);
    }
}
```

The main Web Service endpoint in our Spring Boot, Web application is the
`/session` endpoint, which is accessible from
http//:localhost:8080/session\[\].

The `/session` endpoint outputs 3 bits of information:

1.  The `javax.servlet.http.HttpSession` class type.

2.  Current HTTP Session count.

3.  Current HTTP Request count.

The `HttpSession` class type lets us know which implementation (e.g.
Servlet Container vs. Spring Session) is being used to manage the HTTP
Session state.

The HTTP Request count is simply incremented every time a client HTTP
Request is made to the HTTP server (e.g. Servlet Container) before the
HTTP Session expires. If the HTTP Session expires before another client
HTTP Request is made, then the HTTP Session count is incremented and the
HTTP Request count resets to 1.

### Configuration

Spring Boot, Web Application Configuration

``` highlight
# Spring Boot application.properties for the HTTP Session State Caching Example application.

spring.application.name=HttpSessionCachingApplication
spring.data.gemfire.cache.log-level=${gemfire.log-level:error}
spring.session.data.gemfire.cache.client.pool.name=DEFAULT
spring.session.data.gemfire.session.region.name=Sessions
server.servlet.session.timeout=15
```

The configuration is quite simple. In this case, we have set the HTTP
Session `timeout`, using the `server.servlet.session.timeout` property,
to **15 seconds**. This property is used to configure the HTTP Session
timeout regardless of whether the HTTP Session is being managed by the
Servlet Container or by Spring Session.

Though not strictly necessary, we configured name for the Pool of
connections used by [spring-session-gemfire-name] in case the application is
switched to a client/server topology to the "*DEFAULT*" Pool. We also
explicitly named the Region used to store HTTP Session state as
"*Sessions*" (default name is "*ClusteredSpringSessions*").

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong>
In most production deployments, you will likely be
using a client/server topology, where the HTTP Session is managed by a
cluster of [vmware-gemfire-name] servers so that the HTTP Session can be shared
across multiple instances of the Spring Boot, Web application. This
would be especially true in a cloud environment when utilizing a
Microservices architecture. However, for example purposes, we tried to
keep the sample as simple as possible.
</p>

The default data management policy for the client
cache (a.k.a. Region) used to manage HTTP Session state is a
<code>PROXY</code>, which is the basis for the client/server topology.
Therefore, the default configuration assumes you will be using the
client/server topology in most of your applications.

The main Spring Boot application class is not particularly interesting
other than we have annotated the class with the `@EnableClusterAware`
annotation to seamlessly switch between a client local context and a
client/server topology:

//tag::class[]

public class BootGemFireHttpSessionCachingApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(BootGemFireHttpSessionCachingApplication.class, args);
    }
}
//end::class[]
```

Refer to [spring-boot-gemfire-name]’s documentation to learn about the
[`@EnableClusterAware`](../index.html#geode-configuration-declarative-annotations-productivity-enableclusteraware)
annotation.

### Classpath

The only essential components of the application classpath is a
compile-time dependency on `spring-boot-starter-web`:

`spring-boot-starter-web` compile-time dependency declaration

``` highlight
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

Along with a runtime dependency on `spring-boot-starter-tomcat`. You may
choose to use another Servlet Container, such as Eclipse Jetty by
declaring the `spring-boot-starter-jetty` runtime dependency.

`spring-boot-starter-tomcat` runtime dependency declaration

``` highlight
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-tomcat</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

Spring Boot will detect Apache Tomcat on the application classpath and
bootstrap an embedded, Apache Tomcat Servlet Container using a derived
`WebApplicationContext`.

## Run the Example

Now its time to run the example.

You can run the `BootGemFireHttpSessionCachingApplication` class in your
IDE (e.g. IntelliJ IDEA). Simply create a run profile configuration and
run it. No additional JVM arguments, System Properties or program
arguments are required.

Alternatively, you can run the `BootGemFireHttpSessionCachingApplication`
class from the command-line with the `gradlew` command as follows:

Run the example with `gradlew`

``` highlight
$ gradlew :spring-geode-samples-caching-httpsession:bootRun
```

## Run the Example with Apache Tomcat

After the application starts, open your Web browser to
<a href="http://localhost:8080" class="bare">http://localhost:8080</a>

![HttpSessionCachingApplication](./images/HttpSessionCachingApplication.png)

When we navigate to the `/session` Web service endpoint:

![HttpSessionCachingApplication
ServletContainerSession](./images/HttpSessionCachingApplication-ServletContainerSession.png)

We see that the Servlet Container’s implementing class for the
`javax.servlet.http.HttpSession` interface is
`org.apache.catalina.session.StandardSession`.

If we continue to hit refresh in the Web browser, thereby causing
additional client HTTP requests to be made to the HTTP server, then our
HTTP Request count increments. If we wait for 15 seconds, then the HTTP
Session will expire, and we will see the HTTP Session count increment
along with the HTTP Request count reset to 1:

![HttpSessionCachingApplication
ServletContainerSessionExpiration](./images/HttpSessionCachingApplication-ServletContainerSessionExpiration.png)

Now, we can repeat this same exercise, but this time, using Spring
Session.

### Run the Example with Spring Session

First, we must add Spring Session to the application’s classpath. We do
this simply by adding the `spring-geode-starter-session` runtime
dependency to the classpath of our example application:

`spring-geode-starter-session` runtime dependency declaration

``` highlight
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.geode</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-geode-starter-session</artifactId>
  <scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>
```

The `spring-geode-starter-session` dependency adds Spring Session to the
application’s classpath at runtime and positions [vmware-gemfire-name] as the
provider used to manage the HTTP Session state.

With [vmware-gemfire-name], we gain all the benefits of using a highly
concurrent, highly distributed data management solution that provides
high availability (HA) and resiliency in a cloud environment.

That’s it! This is all we have to do to replace the Servlet’s
Container’s HTTP Session management facilities with a robust, highly
available, highly resilient, clustered solution provided by Spring
Session.

When we run the example again, and access the `/session` Web service
endpoint, we will see:

![HttpSessionCachingApplication
SpringSession](./images/HttpSessionCachingApplication-SpringSession.png)

Now we see that the implementing class for the
`javax.servlet.http.HttpSession` is
`org.springframework.session.web.http.SessionRepositoryFilter$SessionRepositoryRequestWrapper$HttpSessionWrapper`.

Easy!

Of course, the ability to scale-out and optimize the data management
policies for HTTP Session management is very provider-specific (e.g.
[vmware-gemfire-name]) and highly dependent on the use case as well a
application requirements, therefore is beyond the scope of this guide.

## Summary

Spring Session is a powerful framework for managing your HTTP Session
state. Not only does it allow you to plugin different backend data
management providers.

Spring Session also allows you to manage different types of Sessions
depending on the context:

- [*HttpSession*](https://docs.spring.io/spring-session/reference/http-session.html)

- [*WebSocket*](https://docs.spring.io/spring-session/reference/guides/boot-websocket.html)

- [*WebSession*
  (Reactive)](https://docs.spring.io/spring-session/docs/2.2.x/reference/html/websession.html)

Therefore, it makes it a simple matter to switch providers, or adopt
additional Session management capabilities as your application
requirements change and/or your use cases grow.

HTTP Session state caching is one of the most effective and common ways
to utilize caching in your Spring Boot, Web applications, and ensure the
users experience is first-class.
