Like Spring Boot itself (see
[Spring Boot’s documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-external-config.html)), [spring-boot-gemfire-name]
supports externalized configuration.

By externalized configuration, we mean configuration metadata stored in
Spring Boot
[`application.properties`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-external-config.html#boot-features-external-config-application-property-files).
You can even separate concerns by addressing each concern in an
individual properties file. Optionally, you could also enable any given
property file for only a specific
[profile](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-external-config.html#boot-features-external-config-profile-specific-properties).

You can do many other powerful things, such as (but not limited to)
using
[placeholders](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-external-config.html#boot-features-external-config-placeholders-in-properties)
in properties,
[encrypting](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-external-config.html#boot-features-encrypting-properties)
properties, and so on. In this section, we focus particularly on
[type safety](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-external-config.html#boot-features-external-config-typesafe-configuration-properties).

Like Spring Boot, [spring-boot-gemfire-name] provides a
hierarchy of classes that captures configuration for several
[vmware-gemfire-name] features in an associated
`@ConfigurationProperties` annotated class. Again, the configuration
metadata is specified as well-known, documented properties in one or
more Spring Boot `application.properties` files.

For instance, a Spring Boot, [vmware-gemfire-name] `ClientCache`
application might be configured as follows:

Example 1. Spring Boot `application.properties` containing Spring Data
properties for [vmware-gemfire-name]

``` highlight
# Spring Boot application.properties used to configure [vmware-gemfire-name]

spring.data.gemfire.name=MySpringBootApacheGeodeApplication

# Configure general cache properties
spring.data.gemfire.cache.copy-on-read=true
spring.data.gemfire.cache.log-level=debug

# Configure ClientCache specific properties
spring.data.gemfire.cache.client.durable-client-id=123
spring.data.gemfire.cache.client.keep-alive=true

# Configure a log file
spring.data.gemfire.logging.log-file=/path/to/geode.log

# Configure the client's connection Pool to the servers in the cluster
spring.data.gemfire.pool.locators=10.105.120.16[11235],boombox[10334]
```

You can use many other properties to externalize the configuration of
your Spring Boot, [vmware-gemfire-name] applications. See the
[Javadoc](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/data/gemfire/config/annotation/package-frame.html)
for specific configuration properties. Specifically, review the
`enabling` annotation attributes.

You may sometimes require access to the configuration metadata
(specified in properties) in your Spring Boot applications themselves,
perhaps to further inspect or act on a particular configuration setting.
You can access any property by using Spring’s
[`Environment`](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/env/Environment.html)
abstraction:

Example 2. Using the Spring `Environment`

``` highlight
@Configuration
class GeodeConfiguration {

    void readConfigurationFromEnvironment(Environment environment) {
        boolean copyOnRead = environment.getProperty("spring.data.gemfire.cache.copy-on-read",
            Boolean.TYPE, false);
    }
}
```

While using `Environment` is a nice approach, you might need access to
additional properties or want to access the property values in a
type-safe manner. Therefore, you can now, thanks to [spring-boot-gemfire-name]’s
auto-configured configuration processor, access the configuration
metadata by using `@ConfigurationProperties` classes.

To add to the preceding example, you can now do the following:

Example 3. Using `GemFireProperties`

``` highlight
@Component
class MyApplicationComponent {

    @Autowired
    private GemFireProperties gemfireProperties;

    public void someMethodUsingGemFireProperties() {

        boolean copyOnRead = this.gemfireProperties.getCache().isCopyOnRead();

        // do something with `copyOnRead`
    }
}
```

Given a handle to
[`GemFireProperties`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot-data-geode-build/current/api/org/springframework/geode/boot/autoconfigure/configuration/GemFireProperties.html),
you can access any of the configuration properties that are used to
configure [vmware-gemfire-name] in a Spring context. You need only
autowire an instance of `GemFireProperties` into your application
component.

See the complete reference for the
[[spring-boot-gemfire-name] `@ConfigurationProperties` classes and supporting classes](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot-data-geode-build/current/api/org/springframework/geode/boot/autoconfigure/configuration/package-frame.html).

### Externalized Configuration of Spring Session

You can access the externalized configuration of Spring Session when you
use [vmware-gemfire-name] as your (HTTP) session state caching
provider.

In this case, you need only acquire a reference to an instance of the
[`SpringSessionProperties`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot-data-geode-build/current/api/org/springframework/geode/boot/autoconfigure/configuration/SpringSessionProperties.html) class.

As shown earlier in this chapter, you can specify [spring-session-gemfire-name] properties as follows:

Example 4. Spring Boot `application.properties` for Spring Session using
[vmware-gemfire-name] as the (HTTP) session state caching provider

``` highlight
# Spring Boot application.properties used to configure [vmware-gemfire-name] as a (HTTP) session state caching provider
# in Spring Session

spring.session.data.gemfire.session.expiration.max-inactive-interval-seconds=300
spring.session.data.gemfire.session.region.name=UserSessions
```

Then, in your application, you can do something similar to the following
example:

Example 5. Using `SpringSessionProperties`

``` highlight
@Component
class MyApplicationComponent {

    @Autowired
    private SpringSessionProperties springSessionProperties;

    public void someMethodUsingSpringSessionProperties() {

        String sessionRegionName = this.springSessionProperties
            .getSession().getRegion().getName();

        // do something with `sessionRegionName`
    }
}
```
