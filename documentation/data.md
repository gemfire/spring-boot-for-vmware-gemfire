One of the most important tasks during development is ensuring your
Spring Boot application handles data correctly. To verify the accuracy,
integrity, and availability of your data, your application needs data
with which to work.





For those of you already familiar with Spring Boot’s support for
https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/howto.html#howto-initialize-a-database-using-spring-jdbc\[SQL
database initialization\], the approach when using
[vmware-gemfire-name] should be easy to understand.





[vmware-gemfire-name] provides built-in support, similar in function to
Spring Boot’s SQL database initialization, by using:





- Gfsh’s
  https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-GemFire/9.15/gf/tools_modules-gfsh-quick_ref_commands_by_area.html\[import/export\]
  data commands.

- https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-GemFire/9.15/gf/managing-cache_snapshots-chapter_overview.htmll\[Snapshot
  service\]

- hhttps://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-GemFire/9.15/gf/developing-storing_data_on_disk-chapter_overview.html\[Persistence\]
  with
  https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-GemFire/9.15/gf/managing-disk_storage-chapter_overview.html\[disk
  storage\]





For example, by enabling persistence with disk storage, you could
https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-GemFire/9.15/gf/managing-disk_storage-backup_restore_disk_store.html\[backup
and restore\] persistent `DiskStore` files from one cluster to another.





Alternatively, using [vmware-gemfire-name]'s Snapshot Service, you can
export data contained in targeted `Regions` from one cluster during
shutdown and import the data into another cluster on startup. The
Snapshot Service lets you filter data while it is being imported and
exported.





Finally, you can use [vmware-gemfire-name] shell (Gfsh) commands to
https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-GemFire/9.15/gf/tools_modules-gfsh-command-pages-export.html\[export
data\] and
https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-GemFire/9.15/gf/tools_modules-gfsh-command-pages-import.html\[import
data\].

In all cases, the files generated by persistence, the Snapshot Service
and Gfsh’s `export` command are in a proprietary binary format.





Furthermore, none of these approaches are as convenient as Spring Boot’s
database initialization automation. Therefore, [spring-boot-gemfire-name] offers support to import data from JSON
into [vmware-gemfire-name] as PDX.





Unlike Spring Boot, [spring-boot-gemfire-name] offers support to export data as well. By
default, data is imported and exported in JSON format.

for more details. The Spring team strongly recommends that this feature

### Importing Data



You can import data into a `Region` by defining a JSON file that contain
the JSON objects you wish to load. The JSON file must follow a
predefined naming convention and be placed in the root of your
application classpath:





`data-<regionName>.json`





<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 50%" />
<col style="width: 50%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td class="icon">
Note
</td>
<td class="content"><code>&lt;regionName&gt;</code> refers to the
lowercase "name" of the <code>Region</code>, as defined by
https://gemfire.docs.pivotal.io/apidocs/tgf-915/index.html?org/apache/geode/cache/Region.html#getName--[<code>Region.getName()</code>].</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>





For example, if you have a `Region` named "Orders", you would create a
JSON file called `data-orders.json` and place it in the root of your
application classpath (for example, in `src/test/resources`).





Create JSON files for each `Region` that is implicitly defined (for
example, by using `@EnableEntityDefinedRegions`) or explicitly defined
(with `ClientRegionFactoryBean` in Java configuration) in your Spring
Boot application configuration that you want to load with data.





The JSON file that contains JSON data for the "Orders" `Region` might
appear as follows:







Example 1. `data-orders.json`









``` highlight
[{
  "@type": "example.app.pos.model.PurchaseOrder",
  "id": 1,
  "lineItems": [
    {
      "@type": "example.app.pos.model.LineItem",
      "product": {
        "@type": "example.app.pos.model.Product",
        "name": "Apple iPad Pro",
        "price": 1499.00,
        "category": "SHOPPING"
      },
      "quantity": 1
    },
    {
      "@type": "example.app.pos.model.LineItem",
      "product": {
        "@type": "example.app.pos.model.Product",
        "name": "Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max",
        "price": 1249.00,
        "category": "SHOPPING"
      },
      "quantity": 2
    }
  ]
}, {
  "@type": "example.app.pos.model.PurchaseOrder",
  "id": 2,
  "lineItems": [
    {
      "@type": "example.app.pos.model.LineItem",
      "product": {
        "@type": "example.app.pos.model.Product",
        "name": "Starbucks Vente Carmel Macchiato",
        "price": 5.49,
        "category": "SHOPPING"
      },
      "quantity": 1
    }
  ]
}]
```











The application entity classes that matches the JSON data from the JSON
file might look something like the following listing:







Example 2. Point-of-Sale (POS) Application Domain Model Classes









``` highlight
@Region("Orders")
class PurchaseOrder {

    @Id
    Long id;

    List<LineItem> lineItems;

}

class LineItem {

    Product product;
    Integer quantity;

}

@Region("Products")
class Product {

    String name;
    Category category;
    BigDecimal price;

}
```











As the preceding listings show, the object model and corresponding JSON
can be arbitrarily complex with a hierarchy of objects that have complex
types.





#### JSON metadata



We want to draw your attention to a few other details contained in the
object model and JSON shown [earlier](#geode-data-using-import).





##### The `@type` metadata field



First, we declared a `@type` JSON metadata field. This field does not
map to any specific field or property of the application domain model
class (such as `PurchaseOrder`). Rather, it tells the framework and
[vmware-gemfire-name]'s JSON/PDX converter the type of object the JSON
data would map to if you were to request an object (by calling
`PdxInstance.getObject()`).





Consider the following example:







Example 3. Deserializing PDX as an Object









``` highlight
@Repository
class OrdersRepository {

    @Resource(name = "Orders")
    Region<Long, PurchaseOrder> orders;

    PurchaseOrder findBy(Long id) {

        Object value = this.orders.get(id);

        return value instanceof PurchaseOrder ? (PurchaseOrder) value
            : value instanceof PdxInstance ? (PurchaseOrder) ((PdxInstance) value).getObject()
            : null;
    }
}
```











Basically, the `@type` JSON metadata field informs the
`PdxInstance.getObject()` method about the type of Java object to which
the JSON object maps. Otherwise, the `PdxInstance.getObject()` method
would silently return a `PdxInstance`.





It is possible for [vmware-gemfire-name]'s PDX serialization framework
to return a `PurchaseOrder` from `Region.get(key)` as well, but it
depends on the value of PDX’s `read-serialized`, cache-level
configuration setting, among other factors.

https://gemfire.docs.pivotal.io/apidocs/tgf-915/index.html?org/apache/geode/pdx/JSONFormatter.html#JSON_CLASSNAME[<code>JSONFormatter.JSON_CLASSNAME</code>].
As a result, <code>Region</code> data access operations, such as

a Java object.</td>

<code>true</code>. When this property is set, <code>Region</code>
instances are proxied to wrap a <code>PdxInstance</code> in a
<code>PdxInstanceWrapper</code> to appropriately handle the
<code>PdxInstance.getObject()</code> call in your application code.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>







##### The `id` field and the `@identifier` metadata field



Top-level objects in your JSON must have an identifier, such as an `id`
field. This identifier is used as the identity and key of the object (or
`PdxInstance`) when stored in the `Region` (for example,
`Region.put(key, object)`).





You may have noticed that the JSON for the "Orders" `Region` shown
earlier declared an `id` field as the identifier:







Example 4. PurchaseOrder identifier ("id")









``` highlight
[{
  "@type": "example.app.pos.model.PurchaseOrder",
  "id": 1,
  ...
```











This follows the same convention used in Spring Data. Typically, Spring
Data mapping infrastructure looks for a POJO field or property annotated
with
https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/commons/docs/current/api/org/springframework/data/annotation/Id.html\[`@Id`\].
If no field or property is annotated with `@Id`, the framework falls
back to searching for a field or property named `id`.





In [spring-data-gemfire-name], this `@Id`-annotated or
`id`-named field or property is used as the identifier and as the key
for the object when storing it into a `Region`.





However, what happens when an object or entity does not have a surrogate
ID defined? Perhaps the application domain model class is appropriately
using natural identifiers, which is quite common in practice.





Consider a `Book` class defined as follows:







Example 5. Book class









``` highlight
@Region("Books")
class Book {

    Author author;

    @Id
    ISBN isbn;

    LocalDate publishedDate;

    String title;

}
```











As declared in the `Book` class, the identifier for `Book` is its
`ISBN`, since the `isbn` field was annotated with Spring Data’s `@Id`
mapping annotation. However, we cannot know this by searching for an
`@Id` annotation in JSON.





You might be tempted to argue that if the `@type` metadata field is set,
we would know the class type and could load the class definition to
learn about the identifier. That is all fine until the class is not
actually on the application classpath in the first place. This is one of
the reasons why [spring-boot-gemfire-name]’s JSON support serializes JSON to
[vmware-gemfire-name]'s PDX format. There might not be a class
definition, which would lead to a `NoClassDefFoundError` or
`ClassNotFoundException`.





So, what then?





In this case, [spring-boot-gemfire-name] lets you declare the `@identifier` JSON metadata
field to inform the framework what to use as the identifier for the
object.





Consider the following example:







Example 6. Using "@identifer"









``` highlight
{
  "@type": "example.app.books.model.Book",
  "@identifier": "isbn",
  "author": {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Josh Long"
  },
  "isbn": "978-1-449-374640-8",
  "publishedDate": "2017-08-01",
  "title": "Cloud Native Java"
}
```











The `@identifier` JSON metadata field informs the framework that the
`isbn` field is the identifier for a `Book`.









#### Conditionally Importing Data



While the Spring team recommends that users should only use this feature
when developing and testing their Spring Boot applications with
[vmware-gemfire-name], you may still occasionally use this feature in
production.





You might use this feature in production to preload a (REPLICATE) Region
with reference data. Reference data is largely static, infrequently
changing, and non-transactional. Preloading reference data is
particularly useful when you want to warm the cache.





When you use this feature for development and testing purposes, you can
put your `Region`-specific JSON files in `src/test/resources`. This
ensures that the files are not included in your application artifact
(such as a JAR or WAR) when built and deployed to production.





However, if you must use this feature to preload data in your production
environment, you can still conditionally load data from JSON. To do so,
configure the
`spring.boot.data.gemfire.cache.data.import.active-profiles` property
set to the Spring profiles that must be active for the import to take
effect.





Consider the following example:







Example 7. Conditional Importing JSON









``` highlight
# Spring Boot application.properties

spring.boot.data.gemfire.cache.data.import.active-profiles=DEV, QA
```











For import to have an effect in this example, you must specifically set
the `spring.profiles.active` property to one of the valid,
`active-profiles` listed in the import property (such as `QA`). Only one
needs to match.

<td class="icon">
Note
</td>
<td class="content">There are many ways to conditionally build
application artifacts. You might prefer to handle this concern in your
Gradle or Maven build.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>









### Exporting Data



Certain data stored in your application’s `Regions` may be sensitive or
confidential, and keeping the data secure is of the utmost concern and
priority. Therefore, exporting data is **disabled** by default.





However, if you use this feature for development and testing purposes,
enabling the export capability may be useful to move data from one
environment to another. For example, if your QA team finds a bug in the
application that uses a particular data set, they can export the data
and pass it back to the development team to import in their local
development environment to help debug the issue.





To enable export, set the
`spring.boot.data.gemfire.cache.data.export.enabled` property to `true`:







Example 8. Enable Export









``` highlight
# Spring Boot application.properties

spring.boot.data.gemfire.cache.data.export.enabled=true
```











[spring-boot-gemfire-name] is careful to export data to JSON in a format that
[vmware-gemfire-name] expects on import and includes things such as
`@type` metadata fields.

originate from JSON. In this case, you must manually ensure that the
<code>PdxInstance</code> includes an <code>@identifier</code> metadata
field before it is exported to JSON if necessary (for example,
<code>Book.isbn</code>). This is only necessary if your entity classes
do not declare an explicit identifier field, such as with the
<code>@Id</code> mapping annotation, or do not have an <code>id</code>
field. This scenario can also occur when inter-operating with native
clients that model the application domain objects differently and then
serialize the objects by using PDX, storing them in Regions on the
server that are then later consumed by your Java-based, Spring Boot
application.</td>

### Import/Export API Extensions



The API in [spring-boot-gemfire-name] for import and export functionality is separated into
the following concerns:





- Data Format

- Resource Resolving

- Resource Reading

- Resource Writing





By breaking each of these functions apart into separate concerns, a
developer can customize each aspect of the import and export functions.





For example, you could import XML from the filesystem and then export
JSON to a REST-based Web Service. By default, [spring-boot-gemfire-name] imports JSON from the
classpath and exports JSON to the filesystem.





However, not all environments expose a filesystem, such as cloud
environments like TAS. Therefore, giving users control over each aspect
of the import and export processes is essential for performing the
functions in any environment.





#### Data Format



The primary interface to import data into a `Region` is
`CacheDataImporter`.





`CacheDataImporter` is a `@FunctionalInterface` that extends Spring’s
https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/config/BeanPostProcessor.html\[`BeanPostProcessor`\]
interface to trigger the import of data after the `Region` has been
initialized.





The interface is defined as follows:







Example 9. `CacheDataImporter`









``` highlight
interface CacheDataImporter extends BeanPostProcessor {

    Region importInto(Region region);

}
```











You can code the `importInto(:Region)` method to handle any data format
(JSON, XML, and others) you prefer. Register a bean that implements the
`CacheDataImporter` interface in the Spring container, and the importer
does its job.





On the flip side, the primary interface to export data from a `Region`
is the `CacheDataExporter`.





`CacheDataExporter` is a `@FunctionalInterface` that extends Spring’s
https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/config/DestructionAwareBeanPostProcessor.html\[`DestructionAwareBeanPostProcessor`\]
interface to trigger the export of data before the `Region` is
destroyed.





The interface is defined as follows:







Example 10. `CacheDataExporter`









``` highlight
interface CacheDataExporter extends DestructionAwareBeanPostProcessor {

    Region exportFrom(Region region);
}
```











You can code the `exportFrom(:Region)` method to handle any data format
(JSON, XML, and others) you prefer. Register a bean implementing the
`CacheDataExporter` interface in the Spring container, and the exporter
does its job.





For convenience, when you want to implement both import and export
functionality, [spring-boot-gemfire-name] provides the `CacheDataImporterExporter` interface,
which extends both `CacheDataImporter` and `CacheDataExporter`:







Example 11. `CacheDataImporterExporter`









``` highlight
interface CacheDataImporterExporter extends CacheDataExporter, CacheDataImporter { }
```











For added support, [spring-boot-gemfire-name] also provides the
`AbstractCacheDataImporterExporter` abstract base class to simplify the
implementation of your importer/exporter.





##### Lifecycle Management



Sometimes, it is necessary to precisely control when data is imported or
exported.





This is especially true on import, since different `Region` instances
may be collocated or tied together through a cache callback, such as a
`CacheListener`. In these cases, the other `Region` may need to exist
before the import on the dependent `Region` proceeds, particularly if
the dependencies were loosely defined.





Controlling the import is also important when you use [spring-boot-gemfire-name]’s
`@EnableClusterAware` annotation to push configuration metadata from the
client to the cluster in order to define server-side `Region` instances
that match the client-side `Region` instances, especially client
`Region` instances targeted for import. The matching `Region` instances
on the server side must exist before data is imported into client
(`PROXY`) `Region` instances.





In all cases, [spring-boot-gemfire-name] provides the
`LifecycleAwareCacheDataImporterExporter` class to wrap your
`CacheDataImporterExporter` implementation. This class implements
Spring’s
https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/SmartLifecycle.html\[`SmartLifecycle`\]
interface.





By implementing the `SmartLifecycle` interface, you can control in which
`phase` of the Spring container the import occurs. [spring-boot-gemfire-name] also exposes two
more properties to control the lifecycle:







Example 12. Lifecycle Management Properties









``` highlight
# Spring Boot application.properties

spring.boot.data.gemfire.cache.data.import.lifecycle=[EAGER|LAZY]
spring.boot.data.gemfire.cache.data.import.phase=1000000
```











`EAGER` acts immediately, after the `Region` is initialized (the default
behavior). `LAZY` delays the import until the `start()` method is
called, which is invoked according to the `phase`, thereby ordering the
import relative to the other lifecycle-aware components that are
registered in the Spring container.





The following example shows how to make your `CacheDataImporterExporter`
lifecycle-aware:











``` highlight
@Configuration
class MyApplicationConfiguration {

    @Bean
    CacheDataImporterExporter importerExporter() {
        return new LifecycleAwareCacheDataImporterExporter(new MyCacheDataImporterExporter());
    }
}
```















#### Resource Resolution



Resolving resources used for import and export results in the creation
of a Spring
https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/io/Resource.html\[`Resource`\]
handle.





Resource resolution is a vital step to qualifying a resource, especially
if the resource requires special logic or permissions to access it. In
this case, specific `Resource` handles can be returned and used by the
reader and writer of the `Resource` as appropriate for import or export
operation.





[spring-boot-gemfire-name] encapsulates the algorithm for resolving `Resources` in the
`ResourceResolver`
([Strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_pattern)) interface:







Example 13. ResourceResolver









``` highlight
@FunctionalInterface
interface ResourceResolver {

    Optional<Resource> resolve(String location);

    default Resource required(String location) {
        // ...
    }
}
```











Additionally, [spring-boot-gemfire-name] provides the `ImportResourceResolver` and
`ExportResourceResolver` marker interfaces and the
`AbstractImportResourceResolver` and `AbstractExportResourceResolver`
abstract base classes for implementing the resource resolution logic
used by both import and export operations.





If you wish to customize the resolution of `Resources` used for import
or export, your `CacheDataImporterExporter` implementation can extend
the `ResourceCapableCacheDataImporterExporter` abstract base class,
which provides the aforementioned interfaces and base classes.





As stated earlier, [spring-boot-gemfire-name] resolves resources on import from the classpath
and resources on export to the filesystem.





You can customize this behavior by providing an implementation of
`ImportResourceResolver`, `ExportResourceResolver`, or both interfaces
and declare instances as beans in the Spring context:







Example 14. Import & Export ResourceResolver beans









``` highlight
@Configuration
class MyApplicationConfiguration {

    @Bean
    ImportResourceResolver importResourceResolver() {
        return new MyImportResourceResolver();
    }

    @Bean
    ExportResourceResolver exportResourceResolver() {
        return new MyExportResourceResolver();
    }
}
```

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>





##### Customize Default Resource Resolution



If you are content with the provided defaults but want to target
specific locations on the classpath or filesystem used by the import or
export, [spring-boot-gemfire-name] additionally provides the following properties:







Example 15. Import/Export Resource Location Properties









``` highlight
# Spring Boot application.properties

spring.boot.data.gemfire.cache.data.import.resource.location=...
spring.boot.data.gemfire.cache.data.export.resource.location=...
```











The properties accept any valid resource string, as specified in the
Spring
[spring-framework-docs]/core.html#resources-resourceloader\[documentation\]
(see **Table 10. Resource strings**).





This means that, even though import defaults from the classpath, you can
change the location from classpath to filesystem, or even network (for
example, https://) by changing the prefix (or protocol).





Import/export resource location properties can refer to other properties
through property placeholders, but [spring-boot-gemfire-name] further lets you use SpEL inside
the property values.





Consider the following example:







Example 16. Using SpEL









``` highlight
# Spring Boot application.properties

spring.boot.data.gemfire.cache.data.import.resource.location=\
  https://#{#env['user.name']}:#{someBean.lookupPassword(#env['user.name'])}@#{host}:#{port}/cache/#{#regionName}/data/import
```











In this case, the import resource location refers to a rather
sophisticated resource string by using a complex SpEL expression.





[spring-boot-gemfire-name] populates the SpEL `EvaluationContext` with three sources of
information:





- Access to the Spring `BeanFactory`

- Access to the Spring `Environment`

- Access to the current `Region`





Simple Java System properties or environment variables can be accessed
with the following expression:











``` highlight
#{propertyName}
```











You can access more complex property names (including properties that
use dot notation, such as the `user.home` Java System property),
directly from the `Environment` by using map style syntax as follows:











``` highlight
#{#env['property.name']}
```











The `#env` variable is set in the SpEL `EvaluationContext` to the Spring
`Environment`.





Because the SpEL `EvaluationContext` is evaluated with the Spring
`ApplicationContext` as the root object, you also have access to the
beans declared and registered in the Spring container and can invoke
methods on them, as shown earlier with `someBean.lookupPassword(..)`.
`someBean` must be the name of the bean as declared and registered in
the Spring container.

</tbody>

[spring-boot-gemfire-name] also sets the `#regionName` variable in the `EvaluationContext` to
the name of the `Region`, as determined by
https://gemfire.docs.pivotal.io/apidocs/tgf-915/index.html?https://gemfire.docs.pivotal.io/apidocs/tgf-915/index.html?org/apache/geode/cache/Region.html#getName--\[`Region.getName()`\],
targeted for import and export.





This lets you not only change the location of the resource but also
change the resource name (such as a filename).





Consider the following example:







Example 17. Using `#regionName`









``` highlight
# Spring Boot application.properties

spring.boot.data.gemfire.cache.data.export.resource.location=\
    file://#{#env['user.home']}/gemfire/cache/data/custom-filename-for-#{#regionName}.json

#### Reading & Writing Resources



The Spring
https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/io/Resource.html\[`Resource`\]
handle specifies tion of a resource, not how the resource is read or
written. Even the Spring
https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/io/ResourceLoader.html\[`ResourceLoader`\],
which is an interface for loading `Resources`, does not specifically
read or write any content to the `Resource`.





[spring-boot-gemfire-name] separates these concerns into two interfaces: `ResourceReader` and
`ResourceWriter`, respectively. The design follows the same pattern used
by Java’s `InputStream/OutputStream` and `Reader/Writer` classes in the
`java.io` package.





The `ResourceReader` interfaces is defined as:







Example 18. ResourceReader









``` highlight
@FunctionalInterface
interface ResourceReader {

    byte[] read(Resource resource);

}
```











The `ResourceWriter` interfaces is defined as:







Example 19. ResourceWriter









``` highlight
@FunctionalInterface
interface ResourceWriter {

    void write(Resource resource, byte[] data);

}
```











Both interfaces provide additional methods to compose readers and
writers, much like Java’s `Consumer` and `Function` interfaces in the
`java.util.function` package. If a particular reader or writer is used
in a composition and is unable to handle the given `Resource`, it should
throw a `UnhandledResourceException` to let the next reader or writer in
the composition try to read from or write to the `Resource`.





The reader or writer are free to throw a `ResourceReadException` or
`ResourceWriteException` to break the chain of reader and writer
invocations in the composition.





To override the default export/import reader and writer used by [spring-boot-gemfire-name],
you can implement the `ResourceReader` or `ResourceWriter` interfaces as
appropriate and declare instances of these classes as beans in the
Spring container:







Example 20. Custom `ResourceReader` & `ResourceWriter` beans









``` highlight
@Configuration
class MyApplicationConfiguration {

    @Bean
    ResourceReader myResourceReader() {
        return new MyResourceReader()
            .thenReadFrom(new MyOtherResourceReader());
    }

    @Bean
    ResourceWriter myResourceWriter() {
        return new MyResourceWriter();
    }
}
```
