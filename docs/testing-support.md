[Spring Test for
VMware GemFire](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-test-data-geode)
(STDG) is a relatively new project to help you write both unit and
integration tests when you use VMware GemFire in a Spring context.
In fact, the entire
[test suite](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot-data-geode/tree/1.7.4/tree/master/spring-geode-autoconfigure/src/test/java/org/springframework/geode/boot/autoconfigure)
in Spring Boot for VMware GemFire is based on this project.

All Spring projects that integrate with VMware GemFire will use
this new test framework for all their testing needs, making this new
test framework for VMware GemFire a proven and reliable solution
for all your VMware GemFire application testing needs when using
Spring as well.

In future versions, this reference guide will include an entire chapter
on testing along with samples. In the meantime, look to the STDG
[README](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-test-data-geode#stdg-in-a-nutshell).
