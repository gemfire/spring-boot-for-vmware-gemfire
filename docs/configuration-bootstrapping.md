As described in
[geode-clientcache-applications](#geode-clientcache-applications),
you can configure and run a small VMware GemFire cluster from
inside your IDE using Spring Boot. This is extremely helpful during
development because it enables you to manually run, test, and debug your
applications quickly and easily.

Spring Boot for VMware GemFire includes such a class:

Example 11. Spring Boot application class used to configure and
bootstrap a VMware GemFire server


``` highlight
@SpringBootApplication
@CacheServerApplication(name = "SpringBootApacheGeodeCacheServerApplication")
@SuppressWarnings("unused")
public class SpringBootApacheGeodeCacheServerApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        new SpringApplicationBuilder(SpringBootApacheGeodeCacheServerApplication.class)
            .web(WebApplicationType.NONE)
            .build()
            .run(args);
    }

    @Configuration
    @UseLocators
    @Profile("clustered")
    static class ClusteredConfiguration { }

    @Configuration
    @EnableLocator
    @EnableManager(start = true)
    @Profile("!clustered")
    static class LonerConfiguration { }

}
```

This class is a proper Spring Boot application that you can use to
configure and bootstrap multiple VMware GemFire servers and join
them together to form a small cluster. You only need to modify the
runtime configuration of this class to startup multiple servers.

Initially, you will need to start a single (primary) server with an
embedded Locator and Manager.

The Locator enables members in the cluster to locate one another and
lets new members join the cluster as a peer. The Locator also lets
clients connect to the servers in the cluster. When the cache clientâ€™s
connection pool is configured to use Locators, the pool of connections
can intelligently route data requests directly to the server hosting the
data (a.k.a. single-hop access), especially when the data is
partitioned/sharded across multiple servers in the cluster.
Locator-based connection pools include support for load balancing
connections and handling automatic fail-over in the event of failed
connections, among other things.

The Manager lets you connect to this server using Gfsh
(VMware GemFire's
[command-line shell tool](https://geode.apache.org/docs/guide/115/tools_modules/gfsh/chapter_overview.html)).

To start your primary server, create a run configuration in your IDE for
the `SpringBootApacheGeodeCacheServerApplication` class using the
following, recommended JRE command-line options:

Example 12. Server 1 run profile configuration


``` highlight
-server -ea -Dspring.profiles.active=
```

Run the class. You should see output similar to the following:

Example 13. Server 1 output on startup

You can now connect to this server by using Gfsh:

```

Now you can run additional servers to scale-out your cluster.

To do so, you must vary the name of the members you add to your cluster
as peers. VMware GemFire requires members in a cluster to be named
and for the names of each member in the cluster to be unique.

Additionally, since we are running multiple instances of our
`SpringBootApacheGeodeCacheServerApplication` class, which also embeds a
`CacheServer` component enabling cache clients to connect. Therefore,
you must vary the ports used by the embedded services.

Fortunately, you do not need to run another embedded Locator or Manager
(you need only one of each in this case). Therefore, you can switch
profiles from non-clustered to using the Spring "clustered" profile,
which includes different configuration (the `ClusterConfiguration`
class) to connect another server as a peer member in the cluster, which
currently has only one member, as shown in Gfsh with the `list members`
command (shown earlier).

To add another server, set the member name and `CacheServer` port to
different values with the following run configuration:

Example 15. Run profile configuration for server 2


``` highlight
-server -ea -Dspring.profiles.active=clustered -Dspring.data.gemfire.name=ServerTwo -Dspring.data.gemfire.cache.server.port=41414
```

Notice that we explicitly activated the "clustered" Spring profile,
which enables the configuration provided in the nested
`ClusteredConfiguration` class while disabling the configuration
provided in the `LonerConfiguration` class.

The `ClusteredConfiguration` class is also annotated with
`@UseLocators`, which sets the VMware GemFire `locators` property
to "localhost[10334]". By default, it assumes that the Locator runs on
localhost, listening on the default Locator port of 10334. You can
adjust your `locators` connection endpoint if your Locators run
elsewhere in your network by using the `locators` attribute of the
`@UseLocators` annotation.

<td class="content">In production environments, it is common to run
multiple Locators in separate processes. Running multiple Locators
provides redundancy in case a Locator fails. If all Locators in your
cluster fail, then your cluster will continue to run, but no other
members will be able to join the cluster, which is important when
scaling out the cluster. Clients also will not be able to connect.
Restart the Locators if this happens.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Also, we set the `spring.data.gemfire.name` property to `ServerTwo`,
adjusting the name of our member when it joins the cluster as a peer.

Finally, we set the `spring.data.gemfire.cache.server.port` property to
`41414` to vary the `CacheServer` port used by `ServerTwo`. The default
`CacheServer` port is `40404`. If we had not set this property before
starting `ServerTwo`, we would have encounter a
`java.net.BindException`.

Javadoc in SDGâ€™s annotation-based configuration model. For example, see
the Javadoc for the
https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/data/gemfire/config/annotation/CacheServerApplication.html#port--[<code>spring.data.gemfire.cache.server.port</code>

After starting our second server, `ServerTwo`, we should see output
similar to the following at the command-line and in Gfsh when we again
`list members` and `describe member`:

Example 16. Gfsh output after starting server 2


``` highlight
gfsh>list members

```

When we list the members of the cluster, we see `ServerTwo`, and when we
`describe` `ServerTwo`, we see that its `CacheServer` port is
appropriately set to `41414`.

We can add one more server, `ServerThree`, by using the following run
configuration:

Example 17. Add server three to our cluster


``` highlight
-server -ea -Dspring.profiles.active=clustered -Dspring.data.gemfire.name=ServerThree -Dspring.data.gemfire.cache.server.port=42424
```

We again see similar output at the command-line and in Gfsh:

Example 18. Gfsh output after starting server 3


``` highlight
gfsh>list members

Congratulations. You have just started a small VMware GemFire
cluster with 3 members by using Spring Boot from inside your IDE.

Now you can build and run a Spring Boot, VMware GemFire
`ClientCache` application that connects to this cluster. To do so,
include and use Spring Boot for VMware GemFire.
