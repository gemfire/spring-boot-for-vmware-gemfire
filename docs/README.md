# Spring Boot for VMware GemFire docs

[Updated 10/28/2022, daveba#vmware.com)

This directory contains sources for the Spring Boot for VMware GemFire User Guide

Sources were converted from the Spring Boot for Geode asciidoc sources.

Conversion to markdown format is complete, but there's work to do before the user guide will be publishable.

  - Many links are broken or badly formatted
  - Many Geode references remain, particularly in code samples
  - Versioning (2.6 vs 2.7) needs clarification
